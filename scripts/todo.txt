Bugs:
-----
- Overloaded prozedures in DB2 not treated correctly (should work as in Postgres)
- excludeFiles is case-sensitiv
- Export Query Results does not replace macros
- short include @ und nested includes without ; does not owrk
   -> if @t1.sql contains a  "@t2.sql"


ToDo/Cleanup
--------------------
- Change print header and font for header in print preview
- Rework printing
- Refactor TextFileParser/XmlDataParser to much similar code
