Features:
---------
- save table sort of DbExplorer in Workspace
- undo tab close
- open file after "Save Data As"
- WbClipCopy: Copy result set data to the clipboard
- Auto-Completion not working for UPDATE ... FROM .. JOIN
- Generate multi-row inserts (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server) in BatchedStatement instead of using JDBC batch and preparedstatement
- Alternate quoting characters (Oracle's q'[ ]', PostgreSQL $foo$)
- DbExplorer panel showing all indexes (will also enable auto completion for DROP INDEX)
- Treat Oracle's BFILE, Postgres' LargeObjects as BLOBs
- Support external SQL formatter
- Convert DDL from one DBMS to another using "intelligent" search & replace (MySQL -> PG, PG -> Oracle)
- Support N'   ' strings for SQL generation
- WbSchemaDiff offline (compare two XML files generated by WbSchemaReport)
- Access to result data through expressions: where id = ${results[1].columns("foo")}
- "Copy as Select"
- Macros in console mode
- Spreadsheet import (XLS, XLSX, ODS)
- Compare ResultSets
- Support ${...} syntax for calling function during data editing (similar to -constantValues for WbImport)
- Support ${guid} calls
  (or more generic: calling any "registered" Java functions to evaluate values before sending them to the DBMS)
- Filterdefinition: show unique values per column as a dropdown in the dialog
- Paging for console mode
- DbExplorer: dependencies between tables and views (tables used in views, views in which the table is used)
- WbCopy with multiple tables and -deleteTarget (do a delete with dependencies first, then run Copy)
- Show table data from the result of "Search table data" (or make the result editable)
- search BLOB columns as Text in "Search table data"
- DbExplorer rowcount for all tables
- Multi-Threaded WbImport
- "Generate Default ..." in DbExplorer for jOOQ
- SQL Export type as jOOQ Queries
- Workspace "Explorer"
- Option panel to modify DB specific stuff (ddlneedscommit etc)
- Scripting (Groovy, JavaScript, awk, ..)
- ResultSet info display
- Import profiles from other WbProfiles.xml
- Import macros
- Allow full script in DataPumper as SQL Query source
  (pre-copy and post-copy scripts)
- History of selected tables in DbExplorer
- Log statement execution times in separate file (e.g. for performance testing SQL statements)
- hierarchyid, http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb677213.aspx

Bugs:
-----
- Overloaded procedures in DB2 not treated correctly (should work as in Postgres)
- excludeFiles is case-sensitiv
- Export Query Results does not replace macros
- short include @ und nested includes without ; does not owrk
   -> if @t1.sql contains a  "@t2.sql"


ToDo/Cleanup
--------------------
- Rework SQLFormatter, needs to be modularized (one "formatter" for each command, chained together)
- Change print header and font for header in print preview
- Rework printing
