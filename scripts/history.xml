    <description>
      The minimum version for POI (XLS export) has been raised to 3.5 in order to support Microsoft's new OfficeOpen XML Format.
      Therefor the naming of export types has been changed: xls still writes the old (Pre 2003) binary format, xlsx now writes the 
      new OOXML format (Office 2007) and the (new) type xlsm writes the Office 2003 XML format (xlsm is equivalent to the 
      previous xlsx type). To be able to use the new xlsx format, additonal libraries (apart from poi.jar) are needed:
      poi-ooxml.jar, dom4j-1.6.1.jar, geronimo-stax-api_1.0_spec-1.0.jar, ooxml-schemas-1.0.jar and xmlbeans-2.3.0.jar

      The behaviour of the quick search for the auto-completion can now be configured.
      A new option "Partial match" will allow search anywhere in the listed objects (not
      just at the start). Another option allows to filter the displayed items according
      to the quick search value (instead of simply jumping to the first matching item).
      Alphabetic sorting of table columns can now be disabled (in that case, the columns
      are listed in the order as returned by the database).
      The new options have been moved to a separate page in the options dialog

    <description>
      Peter Franken contributed a Log4J integration for SQL Workbench/J. In order to use Log4j, the library log4j.jar (without
      a version number) must be present in the directory where sqlworkbench.jar is located. The log4j.xml must also
      be placed into that directory. To turn on log4j logging, the property workbench.log.log4j must be set to true (either in workbench.settings
      or as a system property)
      If log4j is used, none of the logging properties from workbench.settings will
      be applied. Log4j must be completely configured through log4j.xml.

      For JDBC 4 drivers that support the SQLXML type, XML columns are now displayed directly
      (without the need to use casting or similar methods). Currently it seems that only
      Postgres and DB2 have implemented this properly in their driver.

      A new option to control the behaviour when closing a tab has been added.

       WbCopy (DataPumper) and WbExport into a XML file did not work with Oracle when a NVARCHAR2 column was involved. This was due to the fact that the Oracle driver does not report the correct datatype for. A workaround has been added so that NVARCHAR2 (and NCHAR) columns are treated as java.sql.Types.VARCHAR instead of java.sql.Types.OTHER. This workaround is enabled by default and can be disabled by setting workbench.db.oracle.fixnvarchartype=false in workbench.settings

       Support for stored procedures with OUT parameters has been added for drivers that support the necessary calls. It has been tested with Oracle (11g driver), MySQL (5.0), SQL Server 2005 (Microsoft Driver) and IBM DB9 9 (Linux). The procedure needs to be called with the new keyword WbCall: WbCall myproc(?) All out parameters of the procedure will be displayed. Wehn setting the property: workbench.db.[dbid].procs.use.wbcall=true SQL Workbench/J will also apply the new logic when executing the CALL statement. As this might potentially lead to compatibility problems it is disabled by default.

This is controlled with the property workbench.db.[dbid].ddl.usesavepoint=true Running imports using the update/insert (or insert/update) mode will not work with Postgres as well.

       The handling of date/datetime keywords when entering data has been modified. You can now specify keywords for the three different JDBC datatypes (date, timestamp, time) and the value that is created depends on the type of the keyword (keywords for date will not include the time portion, keywords for time will not incude a date part). The detection is independent of the type of the column (i.e. you can enter current_timestamp in a date column to get the time part as well for e.g. Oracle DATE columns). The differen keywords can be defined in workbench.settings. The default entries are: workbench.db.keyword.current_date=current_date,today workbench.db.keyword.current_time=current_time,now workbench.db.keyword.current_timestamp=current_timestamp,sysdate,systimestamp So when you enter current_date in a date (or timestamp) column the current date without the time (i.e. the time will be 00:00) part will be sent to the DBMS. When you enter e.g. sysdate in a date column the value sent to the DBMS will include the time part.

       Delimiter and alternate Delimiter can now be specified in batch mode as well. The parameter -altDelimiter will only have an effect if a profile-less connection is used (basically defining the alternate delimiter for the temporary profile) The argument -delimiter overrides the default delimiter and will turn off the usage of an alternate delimiter. This can be used if the scripts are not processed in memory but still use a non-standard delimiter (Similar to the -delimiter argument of the WbInclude command). To define a single line delimiter append the ;nl to the delimiter definition. E.g. -delimter=/;nl will define the forward slash as the delimiter but only if it's the only character in a line. -delimiter=GO;nl will define a MS SQL Server compatible delimiter. The additional automatic detection of the GO delimiter has been removed. If you use GO as the delimiter, please change your profiles to use that as the delimiter.

For regular SELECTs in the editor tabs, this has to be done manually by the user by either globally disabling DBMS_OUTPUT in the options dialog or through DISABLEOUT before running a query on a table with a LONG column.

       When running external files using WbInclude the directory of the  currently executed file is used as the "current" directory, so if the executed file is using WbInclude (@) files can be referenced with a relative path.

    <description>
       SQL Workbench now supports reading and writing blob columns to and  from external files. For updating blob and clob columns the usual UPDATE and INSERT statements can be used with placeholders for the file definition. To retrieve a blob the new WbSelectBlob command can be used. When exporting data into an XML file, blob columns are now written into external files (the files are referenced from the XML output) This has been tested with Postgres 8.0, SQL Server (jTDS driver), MySQL, Firebird 1.5 and SQL Anywhere. For Oracle, the 10g driver is required. Earlier drivers do not support the standard JDBC calls used for this feature.

       Oracle 10g drivers do not work properly with Oracle 9i and date  columns. (The time part is not retrieved correctly). SQL Workbench now always treats DATE columns as TIMESTAMP columns (i.e. it will getTimestamp() and java.sql.Timestamp objects for those columns) to preserve the time part. This can be switched off by setting workbench.db.oracle.date.usetimestamp=false in workbench.settings

With workbench.editor.autocompletion.paste.case=lower this behaviour can be controlled in workbench.settings. Allowe values for this property are lower (names are pasted in lower case), upper (names are pasted in upper case) or empty.

       The WbImport command can now switch off the progress display of the current row which speeds up the process when importing from within the GUI (batch import does not suffer from the performance impact of the progress report). To disable the progress use -showprogress=false Alternatively the interval for the reporting can be selected as well -showprogress=100 will only update the display every 100 rows. Additionally the performance of the status display has been improved. Loading large result sets (which report the progress as well) and importing using -showprogress=true (the default) should run quicker now

The threshold can be defined in workbench.settings with the property: workbench.sql.script.inmemory.maxsize The value is defined in bytes. Any file exceeding this size will be processed by not loading it into memory. The default threshold is 1MB (which means that any file that is smaller then 1MB will be processed in memory)

       Several WBEXPORT enhancements: The command now supports the -keycolumns switch, to define the key columns to be used when generating UPDATE statements (to either override the definition from the database, or defined key columns if the table does not have any)
        The command now supports the -sourcetable switch, to directly export one or more tables without the need of an additional SELECT statement. Using the -sourcetable switch requires the -outputdir switch, to define the target directory of the generated files
        The command now supports the -concatfunc switch which allows to set a function that concatenates strings. This is needed for e.g. for MySQL which does not support any (standard) concatenation operator at all. The -concat switch and the -concatfunc switch are mutually exclusive.
        The command now supports transforming the resulting XML file using XSLT. Two new parameters (-stylesheet and -xsltoutput) have been added to support this. The transformation will be executed after the XML file has been created. The transformation can also be executed "standalone" by using the new command XSLT (this could e.g. be used to transform the result of the WBREPORT command into a different format)

       A new option has been added to the connection profile "Rollback before disconnect". Some DBMS (e.g. Cloudscape) require that all pending transactions are ended before disconnecting. Cloudscape already starts a transaction during a SELECT statement, and requires all transactions to be ended before disconnecting. If this option is enabled SQL Workbench/J will issue a rollback before doing the actual disconnect
