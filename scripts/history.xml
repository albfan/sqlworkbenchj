  <release build="95" date="2007-06-09">
    <entry dev-build="8" type="enh">A special date and timestampformat "millis" can now be specified for WbImport (e.g. -timestampFormat=millis). This will treat the value as a numeric value representing the milliseconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 (and thus can be used to create a java.util.Date() object directly)</entry>

    <entry dev-build="6" type="enh">You can now select the elements that should be shown in the main window's title bar. The name of profile group and the current workspace can be enabled/disabled.

    <entry dev-build="6" type="enh">WbImport tries to figure the import type according to the file extension of the import file. Text import is assumed for the extensions txt or csv whereas XML import is assumed for the extension xml When importing compressed exports, the type parameter is still necesary.</entry>
    <entry dev-build="5" type="enh">The handling of date/datetime keywords when entering data has been modified. You can now specify keywords for the three different JDBC datatypes (date, timestamp, time) and the value that is created depends on the type of the keyword (keywords for date will not include the time portion, keywords for time will not incude a date part). The detection is independent of the type of the column (i.e. you can enter current_timestamp in a date column to get the time part as well for e.g. Oracle DATE columns). The differen keywords can be defined in workbench.settings. The default entries are: workbench.db.keyword.current_date=current_date,today workbench.db.keyword.current_time=current_time,now workbench.db.keyword.current_timestamp=current_timestamp,sysdate,systimestamp So when you enter current_date in a date (or timestamp) column the current date without the time (i.e. the time will be 00:00) part will be sent to the DBMS. When you enter e.g. sysdate in a date column the value sent to the DBMS will include the time part.</entry>
    <entry dev-build="5" type="enh">The literals that are accepted as true/false for converting boolean values can now be defined using two new parameters for the WbImport command: -literalsFalse -literalsTrue this also affects the parsing of values for the -booleanToNumber=true mode. The default literals for the number conversion has been limited to true/false. Literals that are not "known" (either through the default or by specifying them using the -literalsXXX switch) are now always rejected (before they were silently converted to false)</entry>
    <entry dev-build="4" type="enh">The automatic conversion of the values true/false to numeric values 1/0 can now be disabled for WbImport using the parameter -booleanToNumber=false (the default is true)</entry>

    <entry dev-build="4" type="enh">WbImport and WbExport can now control how quote characters that are contained in the data are treated. The new argument -quoteCharEscaping defines the expected input format or the format to be written. Possible values are none,duplicate or escape.</entry>
    <entry dev-build="3" type="enh">Using mode=insert,update is no possible with PostgreSQL. Due to PG's error handling this required a savepoint around the INSERT statement that could be rolled back. Doing the INSERT in a sub-transaction with savepoints can be enabled for other DBMS using workbench.db.[dbid].import.usesavepoint=true</entry>
    <entry dev-build="2" type="enh">The application can now automatically check for updates</entry>

    <entry dev-build="2" type="enh">When entering values in date (timestamp) columns the keywords now, sysdate, current_date and current_timestamp are replaced with the current date/time. Note that this will be the local timezone of the machine where SQL Workbench is running, not the time of the DBMS Server</entry>
    <entry dev-build="2" type="enh">Under MacOS the Apple+Q shortcut is now working to exit the application (as well as the about and preferences keys)</entry>

The parameter -altDelimiter will only have an effect if a profile-less connection is used (basically defining the alternate delimiter for the temporary profile) The argument -delimiter overrides the default delimiter and will turn off the usage of an alternate delimiter. This can be used if the scripts are not processed in memory but still use a non-standard delimiter (Similar to the -delimiter argument of the WbInclude command). To define a single line delimiter append the ;nl to the delimiter definition. E.g. -delimter=/;nl will define the forward slash as the delimiter but only if it's the only character in a line. -delimiter=GO;nl will define a MS SQL Server compatible delimiter. The additional automatic detection of the GO delimiter has been removed. If you use GO as the delimiter, please change your profiles to use that as the delimiter.</entry>

    <entry dev-build="1" type="enh">Prepared Statements (i.e. ? in a SELECT) are now supported This support relies on certain JDBC features which are not available e.g. in Oracle's or PostgreSQL's JDBC drivers. Currently this has been tested with Firebird and HSQLDB.</entry>
    <entry dev-build="3" type="enh">The source for stored procedure and views can now be displayed for Informix (thanks Meikel)</entry>
    <entry dev-build="10" type="enh">Errors during script execution can now be ignored by default (SQL -&gt; Ignore errors)</entry>
    <entry dev-build="12" type="enh">When importing text files, columns can now be excluded from the import by specifying $wb_skip$ as the columnname in the -filecolumns parameter or by supplying a list of columns to be imported using the -importcolumns switch</entry>
    <entry dev-build="12" type="enh">When importing text file, filters based on regular expressions can now be applied either on column level or input line level (using the -columnfilter or -linefilter switch)</entry>
    <entry dev-build="12" type="enh">The WbImport command can now switch off the progress display of the current row which speeds up the process when importing from within the GUI (batch import does not suffer from the performance impact of the progress report). To disable the progress use -showprogress=false Alternatively the interval for the reporting can be selected as well -showprogress=100 will only update the display every 100 rows. Additionally the performance of the status display has been improved. Loading large result sets (which report the progress as well) and importing using -showprogress=true (the default) should run quicker now</entry>
    <entry dev-build="14" type="enh">The WBINCLUDE (and batch execution) command will not load script files into memory that exceed a certain size. They will be processed statement by statement which is a bit slower then loading them into memory. The threshold can be defined in workbench.settings with the property: workbench.sql.script.inmemory.maxsize The value is defined in bytes. Any file exceeding this size will be processed by not loading it into memory. The default threshold is 1MB (which means that any file that is smaller then 1MB will be processed in memory)</entry>
    <entry dev-build="17" type="enh">WBIMPORT now supports -importcolumns for XML files to select only certain columns from the input file</entry>
    <entry dev-build="17" type="enh">The DataPumper can now use a text or XML file as the source</entry>
    <entry dev-build="18" type="enh">A new command - WBDIFF - to generate an XML presentation of the difference between to schemas. The XML shows all modifications that need to be done to get the target schema to the same state as the reference (=source) schema. XSLTs to transform this XML into SQL scripts will follow</entry>
    <entry dev-build="19" type="enh">WBIMPORT now accepts -sourcedir for XML files to import all .xml files in that directory. When mixing XML files with long and short tags this works only if the files are created with this build, as the information about the tags used is available in the meta data of the XML file.</entry>
    <entry dev-build="19" type="enh">WBEXPORT now accepts -sourcetable=* to export all tables</entry>
    <entry dev-build="22" type="enh">Two new settings to control the formatting of generated SQL statements: workbench.sql.generate.insert.doformat workbench.sql.generate.update.doformat If set to false generated SQL statements (INSERT, UPDATE) will always be put into a single line.</entry>
    <entry dev-build="27" type="enh">The default behaviour when creating text files with WBEXPORT for writing a header line, can now be defined using the property workbench.export.text.default.header (The existing setting workbench.export.text.includeheader stores the last selection when the export file was created using the GUI rather then WBEXPORT)</entry>
    <entry dev-build="1" type="fix">When a table was created using lowercase in Oracle, the DB Explorer would not work correctly for displaying data and dropping the table</entry>
    <entry dev-build="2" type="fix">Schemas with underscores where not treated correctly when creating UPDATE statements for the result set</entry>
    <entry dev-build="4" type="fix">SELECT statements that were immediately followed by a whitespace other then a regular space were not detected correctly when exporting data.</entry>
    <entry dev-build="4" type="fix">"Show table data" in the DbExplorer did not always use the correct table definition.</entry>
    <entry dev-build="5" type="fix">When a file was saved with an encoding other then the default encoding, the encoding was not properly restored when the workspace was loaded again.</entry>
    <entry dev-build="6" type="fix">Tried to make the workspace loading more robust to avoid corrupted workspaces.</entry>
    <entry dev-build="10" type="fix">SELECT .. INTO did no longer work with Informix and Postgres</entry>
    <entry dev-build="11" type="fix">Sometimes connection errors where not displayed correctly (the application would display the "Connecting to the database..." message indefinitely)</entry>
    <entry dev-build="11" type="fix">Fixed a problem when no workspace file was defined for a connection profile that was introduced with 77.6</entry>
    <entry dev-build="12" type="fix">Fixed a uppercase/lowercase problem when using WBIMPORT</entry>
    <entry dev-build="12" type="fix">When the -file switched is not supplied when using WBIMPORT a clear error message is now given.</entry>
    <entry dev-build="15" type="fix">Fixed a problem with the parsing of SQL statements with comments</entry>
    <entry dev-build="15" type="fix">When importing text files with quote characters, empty fields ("") where not processed correctly (the import would fail with an error)</entry>
    <entry dev-build="16" type="fix">When exporting data from the select SQL statement, this now blocks the current panel (just like executing the statement would do) to avoid conflicts with non-threaded JDBC drivers</entry>
    <entry dev-build="17" type="fix">Ctrl-Enter was still working even if the application was disconnected.</entry>
    <entry dev-build="20" type="fix">Worked around a bug in the Oracle driver which would not return the correct objects for Timestamp (Oracle 9) columns</entry>
    <entry dev-build="22" type="fix">Entering timestamp values did not work.</entry>
    <entry dev-build="23" type="fix">[Oracle] In the DbExplorer the name for table level check constraints was not included in the SQL source</entry>
    <entry dev-build="24" type="fix">When using -charfunc for WBEXPORT the generated SQL Statements were not correct if a non-printable character was immediately followed by another non-printable character.</entry>
    <entry dev-build="25" type="fix">The source for Oracle packages are now displayed correctly</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="fix">Date columns where not exported (Clipboard, WBEXPORT) correctly with Oracle (the export would not use to_date())</entry>
  </release>
  <release build="77" date="2005-02-12">
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">When saving a result set using "Save as", the table to be used for INSERT statements can now be defined. (For UPDATE also, but that requires the retrieval of the PK columns prior to opening the dialog)</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">The usage of the NULL keyword in a CREATE TABLE statement (DbExplorer) can now be configured. If the DBID of the connection is listed in the property workbench.db.nonullkeyword then the NULL keyword will not be used when generating the CREATE TABLE</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">When copying data to the clipboard (Text, SQL), or saving the result set to a file (Data -&gt; Save Data As) the columns that should be include can now be selected. When copying to the clipboard the selection dialog is displayed when pressing the CTRL key while clicking the menu item.</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">When connected to a FirebirdSQL database, the command INPUT can also be used to call one SQL script from another.</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">A query timeout can now be defined (Whether it is really working depends on the capabilities of the JDBC driver)</entry>

    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">Added support for McKoi database</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">The formatting of the generated INSERT statements can now be influenced by setting two properties in workbench.settings: workbench.sql.generate.insert.newlinethreshold defines the number of columns in the table before any reformatting of the column list or values list takes place workbench.sql.generate.insert.colsperline if the INSERT statement affects more then 'newlinethreshold' columns this value defines the number of columns to put into a single line. The default is newlinethreshold=5 and colsperline=1 which results in the same formatting used as before.</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">Added more logging during connect</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">The display format for DATE and DATE/TIME datatypes can now be specified seperately. With Oracle (at least Oracle8) however this does not work because there is no (real) distinction between DATE and TIMESTAMP</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">The usage of the user name for SQL Statements created for "Export" can now be disabled using the property: workbench.export.sql.includeowner=false</entry>

    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">Files can now be dropped on the editor tabs a the dropped file will be loaded into a new tab.</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">The display of messages in the log/message panel can now be controlled by WBFEEDBACK [on|off] This will override the setting from the Options panel until WBFEEDBACK is executed again, or the application is restarted. It does not change the global (default) setting.</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">Files can now be executed using @&lt;filename&gt; or wbinclude &lt;filename&gt; (in contrast to Oracle, this "command" does require a statement delimiter if used together with other statements, e.g. @myfile.sql;</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">Autocommit can be controlled with SET AUTCOMMIT ON/OFF for all DBMS</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">Added sequence definition display for HSQLDB 1.7.2</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">Added basic metadata support for Ingres (Procedure, Trigger, Sequences, Synonyms and View source display)</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">WBEXPORT does not use quoting at all if -quotechar is not specified.</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">The line ending for text and XML export can now be defined through the -lineending switch for the WBEXPORT command. Supported values are: dos,win,crlf for the sequence CHR(13)CHR(10) (=\r\n) and lf,unix for the LF character CHR(10) or \n -lineending=dos is equivalent to -lineending=win and -lineending=crlf -lineending=unix is equivalent to -lineending=lf If no line ending is defined, then the default platform line ending will be used (the textexport did always use LF before)</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">WBEXPORT can now escape non-ascii characters in a unicode manner (e.g. \u0123, \n, \t). This can be enabled with the -escapetext parameter. Valid values for this parameter are: ctrl - escape all characters below ascii 32 7bit - escape all characters below ASCII 32 and above 126 8bit - escape all characters below ASCII 32 and above 255 extended - escape everything outside [32,126] and [161-255] WBIMPORT now supports the -decode switch to read files which contain escaped characters from the WBEXPORT command.</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">WBEXPORT now supports the -quotealways=true flag. In this case the quote character is always put around data values (without this switch the quote character was only used if the delimiter was found in the data value)</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">The schema report written with WBREPORT is now always sorted by table name and the columns are sorted as well to allow better comparison between two different reports.</entry>

  </release>
  <release build="74" date="2004-10-07">
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">When an error occurs during data retrieval, the rows that have been retrieved until then will be retained and a warning will be displayed in the message panel</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">Added -emptystringnull for text import (WbIMPORT) to specify the behaviour for empty strings during import. -emptystringnull=true will insert a NULL value for an empty string (string of length zero)</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">Updated support for Cloudscape to include the move to Apache Derby</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">When searching for text in the editor and the search string is not found, a message is now displayed.</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">When executing several statements, the currently executed statement can now be highlighted</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">An XML report of the database tables can now be generated using the WBREPORT command or from within the table list of the database explorer.</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">If a table does not have primary key columns defined, the key columns that should be used for updating the table can now be defined (implicitely all columns were used before)</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">Several WBEXPORT enhancements: The command now supports the -keycolumns switch, to define the key columns to be used when generating UPDATE statements (to either override the definition from the database, or defined key columns if the table does not have any) The command now supports the -sourcetable switch, to directly export one or more tables without the need of an additional SELECT statement. Using the -sourcetable switch requires the -outputdir switch, to define the target directory of the generated files The command now supports the -concatfunc switch which allows to set a function that concatenates strings. This is needed for e.g. for MySQL which does not support any (standard) concatenation operator at all. The -concat switch and the -concatfunc switch are mutually exclusive. The command now supports transforming the resulting XML file using XSLT. Two new parameters (-stylesheet and -xsltoutput) have been added to support this. The transformation will be executed after the XML file has been created. The transformation can also be executed "standalone" by using the new command XSLT (this could e.g. be used to transform the result of the WBREPORT command into a different format)</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">Cancelling a SELECT statement now works also for JDBC drivers that do not support the cancel() operation.</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">The source display in the DbExplorer can now be expanded to cover the full width by using Ctrl-Shift-T (or the little arrows in the split display). The shortcut actually toggles the display between full width and split display</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">Only selected rows can now be copied to the clipboard (as text, INSERT or UPDATE statements)</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">If the password should not be stored for a profile, the user is now prompted to enter the password when trying to connect using that profile</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">For Oracle, table and column comments are now also created in the SQL statement to recreate a table. This requires that the Oracle JDBC driver returns the comments. See the online help for details on how to configure the connection to Oracle to show comments</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">A new option has been added to the connection profile "Rollback before disconnect". Some DBMS (e.g. Cloudscape) require that all pending transactions are ended before disconnecting. Cloudscape already starts a transaction during a SELECT statement, and requires all transactions to be ended before disconnecting. If this option is enabled SQL Workbench/J will issue a rollback before doing the actual disconnect</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">The logging has been improved. Logging to the console can now be disabled (workbench.log.console=false). If enabled it will now log to System.err (instead of System.out). The format of the log message can now be defined through workbench.log.format Valid placeholders are: {type} DEBUG, INFO etc {timestamp} {message} The actual log message {error} The error message from the exception (if present) {source} Where the error occurred {stacktrace} The exception stacktrace if any (will always be displayed after the log message regardless of the position in the format string If the level is set to debug, the stacktrace will always be displayed</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">The batch runner now displays the messages returned from the individual commands to System.out and doesn't use the logging facility any more. Combined with workbench.log.console=false the output of a batch run is now very similar to the messages printed in the GUI. Additionally result sets (if available) can now be printed to the console using the commandline switch -displayresult=true</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">Views and triggers are now displayed for Cloudscape in the Database Explorer</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">Added the commandline switch -ignoredroperrors for batch mode. This sets the "Ignore errors from DROP commands" property for the connection (same effect as connecting with a profile where this behaviour is enabled)</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">Variable subsitution is now supported. Variables can be defined interactively (using WBVARDEF) from a file or as the result of a SQL query. A variable can be referenced so that Workbench prompts never, only once or always for a value. For details see the online help.</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">When pressing Shift while selecting one of the "Optimize Column Width" menu items, the column label will be taken into account for the optimal size. Ctrl-Shift-W will optimize all columns with respecting to the column's name. This shortcut cannot be remapped currently.</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="fix">The SQL history is now written in UTF-8 to preserve special characters</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="fix">When the application was closed the user was asked up to three times if he wants to save modified files</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="fix">When importing textfiles, the dot was not the default decimal separator as stated in the manual</entry>

    <entry dev-build="28" type="fix">When an error occurred during an import into the current result set choosing "Cancel" or "Ignore all" had no effect, the import would continue in either case.</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="fix">When clicking quickly in the list of tables in the DbExplorer, it could happen, that the application locked up (when the DB responded to slowly)</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="fix">SQL Statements that contained german umlauts (and possibly other non ASCII characters) would fail to execute</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="fix">When importing a text file empty values for numeric fields gave an error. They are now treated as NULL.</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="fix">When trying to delete multiple rows before switching to edit mode, only the first row was deleted (because switching to edit mode resets the row selection)</entry>
