  </release>
  <release build="95" date="2007-06-09">
    <entry dev-build="8" type="enh">A special date and timestampformat "millis" can now be specified for WbImport (e.g. -timestampFormat=millis). This will treat the value as a numeric value representing the milliseconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 (and thus can be used to create a java.util.Date() object directly)</entry>
    <entry dev-build="8" type="enh">When using -lobIdCols with WbExport the name of the export file is no longer part of the generated LOB filename if -compress=true is used.</entry>
    <entry dev-build="6" type="enh">Ctrl-Shift-C (Comment Selection) now acts as a toggle. If this is invoked on a text that is not commented, the line comment character will be added. If the complete selection is already commented, then the comments will be removed. Ctrl-Shift-U (Uncomment Selection) works as before</entry>
    <entry dev-build="6" type="enh">You can now select the elements that should be shown in the main window's title bar. The name of profile group and the current workspace can be enabled/disabled. The display of the current editor's filename has been moved from the "Editor" page in the options dialog to the new "Window Title" page.</entry>
    <entry dev-build="6" type="enh">WbImport tries to figure the import type according to the file extension of the import file. Text import is assumed for the extensions txt or csv whereas XML import is assumed for the extension xml When importing compressed exports, the type parameter is still necesary.</entry>
    <entry dev-build="5" type="enh">The handling of date/datetime keywords when entering data has been modified. You can now specify keywords for the three different JDBC datatypes (date, timestamp, time) and the value that is created depends on the type of the keyword (keywords for date will not include the time portion, keywords for time will not incude a date part). The detection is independent of the type of the column (i.e. you can enter current_timestamp in a date column to get the time part as well for e.g. Oracle DATE columns). The differen keywords can be defined in workbench.settings. The default entries are: workbench.db.keyword.current_date=current_date,today workbench.db.keyword.current_time=current_time,now workbench.db.keyword.current_timestamp=current_timestamp,sysdate,systimestamp So when you enter current_date in a date (or timestamp) column the current date without the time (i.e. the time will be 00:00) part will be sent to the DBMS. When you enter e.g. sysdate in a date column the value sent to the DBMS will include the time part.</entry>
    <entry dev-build="5" type="enh">The literals that are accepted as true/false for converting boolean values can now be defined using two new parameters for the WbImport command: -literalsFalse -literalsTrue this also affects the parsing of values for the -booleanToNumber=true mode. The default literals for the number conversion has been limited to true/false. Literals that are not "known" (either through the default or by specifying them using the -literalsXXX switch) are now always rejected (before they were silently converted to false)</entry>

    <entry dev-build="4" type="enh">WbImport and WbExport can now control how quote characters that are contained in the data are treated. The new argument -quoteCharEscaping defines the expected input format or the format to be written. Possible values are none,duplicate or escape.</entry>
    <entry dev-build="3" type="enh">Using mode=insert,update is no possible with PostgreSQL. Due to PG's error handling this required a savepoint around the INSERT statement that could be rolled back. Doing the INSERT in a sub-transaction with savepoints can be enabled for other DBMS using workbench.db.[dbid].import.usesavepoint=true</entry>

    <entry dev-build="2" type="enh">When entering values in date (timestamp) columns the keywords now, sysdate, current_date and current_timestamp are replaced with the current date/time. Note that this will be the local timezone of the machine where SQL Workbench is running, not the time of the DBMS Server</entry>

To define a single line delimiter append the ;nl to the delimiter definition. E.g. -delimter=/;nl will define the forward slash as the delimiter but only if it's the only character in a line. -delimiter=GO;nl will define a MS SQL Server compatible delimiter.

    <entry dev-build="3" type="enh">The case (upper, lower, as is) for table names in generated SQL statements can now be set independently from the paste case in the editor.

If this is set to true, then after sending a batch to the server commit() is called. This is slightly different to using -commitEvery with the value of the batchSize parameter. The latter one will add a COMMIT statement to the batch queue, rather than calling the JDBC commit() method, because some drivers do not allow a COMMIT statement inside the batch queue.</entry>

For updating blob and clob columns the usual UPDATE and INSERT statements can be used with placeholders for the file definition. To retrieve a blob the new WbSelectBlob command can be used. When exporting data into an XML file, blob columns are now written into external files (the files are referenced from the XML output) This has been tested with Postgres 8.0, SQL Server (jTDS driver), MySQL, Firebird 1.5 and SQL Anywhere. For Oracle, the 10g driver is required. Earlier drivers do not support the standard JDBC calls used for this feature.</entry>

    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">Several WBEXPORT enhancements: The command now supports the -keycolumns switch, to define the key columns to be used when generating UPDATE statements (to either override the definition from the database, or defined key columns if the table does not have any) The command now supports the -sourcetable switch, to directly export one or more tables without the need of an additional SELECT statement. Using the -sourcetable switch requires the -outputdir switch, to define the target directory of the generated files The command now supports the -concatfunc switch which allows to set a function that concatenates strings. This is needed for e.g. for MySQL which does not support any (standard) concatenation operator at all. The -concat switch and the -concatfunc switch are mutually exclusive. The command now supports transforming the resulting XML file using XSLT. Two new parameters (-stylesheet and -xsltoutput) have been added to support this. The transformation will be executed after the XML file has been created. The transformation can also be executed "standalone" by using the new command XSLT (this could e.g. be used to transform the result of the WBREPORT command into a different format)</entry>

This requires that the Oracle JDBC driver returns the comments. See the online help for details on how to configure the connection to Oracle to show comments</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">A new option has been added to the connection profile "Rollback before disconnect". Some DBMS (e.g. Cloudscape) require that all pending transactions are ended before disconnecting. Cloudscape already starts a transaction during a SELECT statement, and requires all transactions to be ended before disconnecting. If this option is enabled SQL Workbench/J will issue a rollback before doing the actual disconnect</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">The logging has been improved. Logging to the console can now be disabled (workbench.log.console=false). If enabled it will now log to System.err (instead of System.out). The format of the log message can now be defined through workbench.log.format Valid placeholders are: {type} DEBUG, INFO etc {timestamp} {message} The actual log message {error} The error message from the exception (if present) {source} Where the error occurred {stacktrace} The exception stacktrace if any (will always be displayed after the log message regardless of the position in the format string If the level is set to debug, the stacktrace will always be displayed</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">The batch runner now displays the messages returned from the individual commands to System.out and doesn't use the logging facility any more. Combined with workbench.log.console=false the output of a batch run is now very similar to the messages printed in the GUI. Additionally result sets (if available) can now be printed to the console using the commandline switch -displayresult=true</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">Views and triggers are now displayed for Cloudscape in the Database Explorer</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">Added the commandline switch -ignoredroperrors for batch mode. This sets the "Ignore errors from DROP commands" property for the connection (same effect as connecting with a profile where this behaviour is enabled)</entry>
    <entry dev-build="28" type="enh">Variable subsitution is now supported. Variables can be defined interactively (using WBVARDEF) from a file or as the result of a SQL query. A variable can be referenced so that Workbench prompts never, only once or always for a value. For details see the online help.</entry>
