Build 83, 20.11.2005
--------------------
Enh:  (82.1) When running external files using WbInclude the directory of the 
      currently executed file is used as the "current" directory, so if the 
      executed file is using WbInclude (@) files can be referenced with a 
      relative path.
Enh:  (82.1) SQL Workbench now supports reading and writing blob columns to and 
      from external files. For updating blob and clob columns the usual 
      UPDATE and INSERT statements can be used with placeholders for the file 
      definition. To retrieve a blob the new WbSelectBlob command can be used. 
      When exporting data into an XML file, blob columns are now written
      into external files (the files are referenced from the XML output)
      This has been tested with Postgres 8.0, SQL Server (jTDS driver), MySQL,
      Firebird 1.5 and SQL Anywhere.
      For Oracle, the 10g driver is required. Earlier drivers do not support 
      the standard JDBC calls used for this feature.
Enh:  (82.1) When "confirming" updates, there was no way to cancel the execution
      completely. WbInclude is now also considered as an "updating" command.
Enh:  (82.2) Oracle 10g drivers do not work properly with Oracle 9i and date 
      columns. (The time part is not retrieved correctly). SQL Workbench now 
      always treats DATE columns as TIMESTAMP columns (i.e. it will 
      getTimestamp() and java.sql.Timestamp objects for those columns) to 
      preserve the time part. This can be switched off by setting 
      workbench.db.oracle.date.usetimestamp=false
      in workbench.settings
Enh:  (82.2) Added support for views, stored procedures and triggers for 
      MySQL 5.x in DbExplorer
Enh:  (82.3) WbReport now includes VIEW definitions
Enh:  (82.3) Added support for views and triggers for Apache Derby in DbExplorer
Enh:  (82.3) The password in the connection dialog can now be displayed in plain
      text
Enh:  (82.6) With WbImport -truncatetable=true can be used as a shortcut
      for -deletetarget=true -usetruncate=true. If -truncatetable is present
      -deletetarget will be ignored.
Enh:  (82.15) Filters can now be applied to all columns with a single expression
Enh:  (82.16) Oracle public synonyms can now optionally be included in the 
      auto completion popup. To enable this, a new property is available in 
      workbench.settings:
      workbench.editor.autocompletion.oracle.public_synonyms=true
Enh:  (82.18) The data tab in the DbExplorer now displays the current table name      
Enh:  (82.25) Tried to make concurrent access to the same connection more robust
Enh:  (82.27) The WbExport command can now write a skeleton for an SQL*Loader 
      control file when -oraldr=true is specified
Enh:  (82.28) Postgres: The source for a table now includes the index definition 
      as returned by the view pg_indexes, thus indexes with operator classes are 
      displayed correctly. The Index tab will still display it incorrectly though
      (the JDBC driver does not return the information)
Enh:  (82.29) WbDiff now includes Views
Enh:  (82.29) The "Create DDL Script" is now also available in the Procedures tab
      of the DBExplorer, not only the Objects tab.
Enh:  (82.30) Basic support for Oracle materialized views added

Fix:  (82.1) When an error occurs during inserting of new rows from a result set, 
      and the error is ignored, the status for the incorrect rows is lost, and 
      subsequent saving of the data will generate an UPDATE statement instead
      of an INSERT statement
Fix:  (82.2) When importing XML files with a CLOB column SQL Workbench/J would
      report an error. 
Fix:  (82.4) Fixed an error when loading files into the editor (files with CR/LF 
      ending were not loaded correctly)
Fix:  (82.5) Since 82.3 the assigned workspace file was not shown any longer in 
      the connection dialog
Fix:  (82.6) The defaults stated in the help for the WbDiff command did not  
      match the actual defaults used. The constraint comparing is now reported 
      correctly in the XML file as well.
Fix:  (82.6) The first column of a result set could not be edited any more.      
Fix:  (82.7) If an invalid regular expression is entered in the search dialog 
      of the editor, an error message is now displayed.
Fix:  (82.9) Replace & Next was not using regular expressions correctly for the 
      replacement string      
Fix:  (82.11) -decimal did not work for text imports
Fix:  (82.13) The tree display of foreign key references did not work any more
Fix:  (82.14) "Replace all" did not work any longer in the editor
Fix:  (82.15) When using a different table name for the generated script with 
      WbExport (with -type=sqlinsert) together with the -createtable option 
      the alternate name was not used for the PK, FK and Index definition.
Fix:  (82.18) Importing CLOB columns in Oracle did not work      
Fix:  (82.33) Checking for the MS SQL "GO" delimiter did not work properly 
Fix:  (82.34) When "Retrieve Explorer" was disabled, nothing was retrieved at 
      all when the Explorer was opened in a separate window
Fix:  (82.35) When using "Save Data as" date and timestamp columns were not
      written into the export file if not format was specified.

Build 82, 12.09.2005
--------------------
Fix:  @filename.sql was not working any longer
Fix:  Import of text files with the column definition in the header line was not 
      working

Build 81, 11.09.2005
--------------------
Enh:  (80.33) The filter definitions now support IS NULL and IS NOT NULL comparator
Enh:  (80.32) Auto completion now supports CREATE VIEW statements.
Enh:  (80.30) The SQL that is used for the UPDATE Statement in the WbImport command
      can now be "enhanced" with an additional WHERE clause. This can be specified
      with the parameter -updatewhere for the WbImport command. If this is specified
      e.g. -updatewhere="column=value" then this expression will be appended to the
      generated UPDATE statement with an AND condition. e.g. 
      UPDATE table SET col1=?, col2=? WHERE id=? AND (column=value)
      If the expression starts with the keyword AND or OR, then it will appended
      to the UPDATE staement as it is. If it does not start with either of the two
      keywords, it will be put into brackets and appended using AND.
      The expression -updatewhere="AND (col5=42 OR col5 = 43)" will be append "as is" 
      to the generated UPDATE statement.
Enh:  (80.29) The execution time of the last statement is now also shown
      in the statusbar.
Enh:  (80.26) The object types that are considered by the DbExplorer to contain
      data (i.e. that can be used in a SELECT statement) can now be configured. 
      The default setting is stored in the property 
      workbench.db.objecttype.data.default
      This can be overwritten for a specific dbms by replacing default with the
      DBID for the server, e.g. rdb or oracle
      
      workbench.db.objecttype.selectable.rdb=table,view,system,system view
      
      The values that should be listed in that property can be taken from 
      the TYPE column in the Object list of the DbExplorer
Enh:  (80.19) If a editor tab is associated with a file, the filename can now
      be displayed in the window title. This can be configured in workbench.settings
      with the property workbench.gui.display.showfilename 
      Possible values are none,name,path. If this property is set to "name", then 
      only the name of the current file (if any) is displayed in the window title.
      If it is set to "path", the full path will be displayed in the window title. 
      Otherwise (i.e. if the property is empty, or not present) the filename is
      not displayed at all.
Enh:  (80.19) Columns that are defined as NOT NULL are now displayed with 
      a different background color during editing. This feature can be disabled
      using the property:
      workbench.gui.edit.requiredfield.dohighlight=false
      The default highlight color is:
      workbench.gui.edit.requiredfield.color=255,100,100
      and can be changed with that property
Enh:  (80.18) The file to be used to store the connection profiles can now 
      be specified on the commandline using -profilestorage=filename.xml
      If the filename does not contain a directory, the configuration directory
      is used to search for the file, otherwise the full filename is used.
Enh:  (80.18) Editor Tabs that contain a file can now be renamed as well.
      The full filename is only available as the tooltip of the tab. To 
      restore the title to the file's name, rename the tab to an "empty" name
Enh:  (80.18) The editor tabs can now be re-ordered (right click on the
      tab, choose "Move left" or "Move right"
Enh:  (80.18) The retrieval of the row count can now be configured in the 
      data tab of the DbExplorer (using the "Settings" button)
Enh:  (80.17) Added a column filter and searcher to the column list display
      in the DbExplorer
Enh:  (80.13) The table list in the DbExplorer now uses a filter instead
      of simply searching for an object name.
Enh:  (80.12) Filtering of the resultset is now possible
Enh:  (80.6) Support for completion of INSERT statements added
Enh:  (80.10) The DbExplorer now lets you define the key columns for a table 
      in the data tab.
Fix:  (80.1) Fixed incorrect quoting for table names when creating 
      statements to save the changes to the data.
Fix:  (80.2) Fixed some errors in the generation of DbDesigner files
Fix:  (80.2) When using single line comments in the FROM list, the comments
      would show up in the generated update statemens when editing the data
Fix:  (80.3) When connecting to a database profile with a workspace assigned
      while a workspace was loaded the last tab would be removed from
      the currently active workspace
Fix:  (80.4) Re-introduced fix for the bug in Oracle 9 
      regarding the wrong information vor VARCHAR columns if NLS_LENGTH_SEMANTICS
      is set to char
Fix:  (80.5) Displaying procedures did not work any longer
Fix:  (80.7) Automatically detecting the alternate delimiter did not work 
      properly when using @ as a replacement of the WbInclude command
Fix:  (80.8) BIT and BOOLEAN fields where not handled correctly when importing
      XML files generated by SQL Workbench/J
Fix:  (80.9) Prevent endless loops with faulty JDBC drivers when retrieving warnings
      and errors after a retrieval.
Fix:  (80.12) When closing the search dialog in the editor with the ESC
      key, the search was performed anyway.
Fix:  (80.14) Fixed a bug with the autocompletion of columns in DELETE 
      statements
Fix:  (80.15) Using Ctrl-Space as the shortcut for code completion now works
      properly
Fix:  (80.19) The generated SQL for foreign key constraints in Oracle would 
      contain an "ON DELETE" rule which is not supported by Oracle
Fix:  (80.19) If the name of an editor tab contained a number equal to the 
      index of the tab, the shortcut was not displayed correctly
Fix:  (80.19) The scripts for SYNONYMs and SEQUENCEs were not created in 
      the DbExplorer (Create DDL Script)
Fix:  (80.19) When importing a text file that has fewer columns then the 
      target table, not all columns were imported properly
Fix:  (80.19) When a DbExplorer tab was currently selected, creating a new 
      SQL Tab did not work properly with JDK 1.5
Fix:  (80.20) The order of the foreign key/primary key columns was not correct 
      in the generated source for a table
Fix:  (80.21) Defined Filters were not displayed correctly when re-defining
Fix:  (80.25) WbReport now ensures, that the values stored in the DB Info part
      are valid XML by replacing potential illegal characters (e.g. (char)0) 
Fix:  (80.25) The size (width) limitation for the schema selector in the 
      DbExplorer has been removed 
Fix:  (80.25) New tabs were not always selected correctly (i.e. a different
      tab was considered the active tab)
Fix:  (80.35) When importing several files with the WbImport command that
      specified a different schema then the current one, SQL Workbench/J 
      tried to delete the tables in the schema defined by the files not
      by the -schema switch.
Fix:  (80.37) If running SQLWorkbench/J in batch mode and the specified connection 
      profile was not found, no clear error message was shown.
      
Build 80, 26.06.2005
--------------------
Enh:  (79.1) Workbench commands are now formatted correctly when using
      "Format SQL"
Enh:  (79.3) Added support for the new CHECK constraints in FirstSQL/J
Enh:  (79.3) Added a new menu item for controlling auto commit
Enh:  (79.3) Enhanced the performace of WBINCLUDE when processing scripts
      that are not read into memory completely.
Enh:  (79.3) Multiple Database Explorer windows and/or tabs can now be
      opened. The existing "Show Database Explorer" menu works as before.
      Additionally there is "New Db Explorer tab" and "New DbExplorer Window"
      It is strongly recommended to use the option "Separate connection for
      each tab" in this case to avoid threading problems in the JDBC driver
Enh:  (79.3) Sorting inside the result has been changed slightly. For
      performace reasons Strings are now compared using Java's internal
      compare which might produce incorrect results for certain languages
      (http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#compareTo(java.lang.String))
      To enable a language and country specific collation please use the
      following properties in workbench.setttings:
      workbench.sort.usecollator=true
      workbench.sort.language
      workbench.sort.country
      to specify the collation that should be used.
Enh:  (79.4) Code completion for tables and columns is now available. It can
      be activated by Ctrl-Q while the cursor is inside a SELECT, INSERT
      or UPDATE statement (other statements are not yet supported). To correctly
      identify the objects that need to be displayed it is required that the 
      statement is somewhat correct (it does not need to be complete, but 
      the statements in the editor have to be separated using ;)
      When a column or table name is pasted into the editor, it is pasted
      the way the JDBC driver returned the name. With
      workbench.editor.autocompletion.paste.case=lower
      this behaviour can be controlled in workbench.settings.
      Allowe values for this property are lower (names are pasted in lower case), 
      upper (names are pasted in upper case) or empty. If the property is empty
      or not present at all (default) then the names are pasted as they are
      returned from the driver
Enh:  (79.5) The usage of the schema name in DML statements generated by SQL Workbench
      can now be controlled. To do this, add the line 
      workbench.sql.ignoreschema.<dbid1>=schema1,...
      You can use * to ignore omit all schemas in DML statements, or list each 
      schema that should be ignored (e.g. PUBLIC) separately.
      The <dbid> that is generated for your DBMS is reported in the log file after a 
      successful connection (the log level needs to be set to INFO). 
      Look for the text "Using DBID"
Enh:  (79.6) WbImport now supports the -sourcedir parameter for text files as well.
Enh:  (79.6) WbDiff now supports more parameters to control the level of comparison
Enh:  (79.8) Added a workaround for the PostgreSQL JDBC driver not understanding
      the "dollar" quoting when creating functions.
Enh:  (79.12) Support for schema changes in HSQLDB and Oracle added

Fix:  (79.1) When no tables were found using WbExport -sourcetable=* no proper
      error was reported.
Fix:  (79.1) When using WbXslt the output file was not close properly and thus
      locked until the application was ended
Fix:  (79.1) When changing the selected table in the DbExplorer while a
      table definition was loaded, the application could hang.
Fix:  (79.2) Display (and export) of the time part of an Oracle DATE column
      was broken
Fix:  (79.3) when running "SET AUTOCOMMIT" the commit and rollback toolbar
      buttons where not enabled/disabled accordingly
Fix:  (79.3) Fixed a problem in the SQL parser with single line comments
      in the last statement of the editor
Fix:  (79.3) WBINCLUDE was not working if no encoding was specified
Fix:  (79.3) WBCOPY was not working when beeing used from within a batchfile
Fix:  (79.7) Fixed some problems with WBCOPY and creating tables during copying
Fix:  (79.7) When creating Oracle packages, errors were not shown correctly
Fix:  (79.7) Postgres' JDBC driver does not understand the "dollar quoting" 
      when creating stored procedures. A workaround was implemented to be 
      able to run the same scripts as with psql
Fix:  (79.9) Fixed a problem with detecting the "current" statement in the editor
      when using Ctrl-Enter
Fix:  (79.13) Cancelling a WbExport is now more reliable.
Fix:  (79.15) Fixed a bug in the handling of BIGINT columns.

Build 79, 25.04.2005
--------------------
Fix:  WbImport was not working if no encoding was specified

Build 78, 24.04.2005
--------------------
Enh:  (77.1) Prepared Statements (i.e. ? in a SELECT) are now supported
      This support relies on certain JDBC features which are
      not available e.g. in Oracle's or PostgreSQL's JDBC drivers.
      Currently this has been tested with Firebird and HSQLDB.
Enh:  (77.3) The source for stored procedure and views can now be
      displayed for Informix (thanks Meikel)
Enh:  (77.10) Errors during script execution can now be ignored by default
      (SQL -> Ignore errors)
Enh:  (77.12) When importing text files, columns can now be excluded
      from the import by specifying $wb_skip$ as the columnname
      in the -filecolumns parameter or by supplying a list of
      columns to be imported using the -importcolumns switch
Enh:  (77.12) When importing text file, filters based on regular expressions
      can now be applied either on column level or input line level
      (using the -columnfilter or -linefilter switch)
Enh:  (77.12) The WbImport command can now switch off the progress display
      of the current row which speeds up the process when importing from
      within the GUI (batch import does not suffer from the performance
      impact of the progress report). To disable the progress use
      -showprogress=false
      Alternatively the interval for the reporting can be selected as
      well -showprogress=100 will only update the display every 100 rows.
      Additionally the performance of the status display has been improved.
      Loading large result sets (which report the progress as well) and
      importing using -showprogress=true (the default) should run quicker now
Enh:  (77.14) The WBINCLUDE (and batch execution) command will not load script
      files into memory that exceed a certain size. They will be processed
      statement by statement which is a bit slower then loading them into
      memory. The threshold can be defined in workbench.settings with the
      property: workbench.sql.script.inmemory.maxsize
      The value is defined in bytes. Any file exceeding this size will be
      processed by not loading it into memory. The default threshold
      is 1MB (which means that any file that is smaller then 1MB will be
      processed in memory)
Enh:  (77.17) WBIMPORT now supports -importcolumns for XML files to
      select only certain columns from the input file
Enh:  (77.17) The DataPumper can now use a text or XML file as the source
Enh:  (77.18) A new command - WBDIFF - to generate an XML presentation of the
      difference between to schemas. The XML shows all modifications that
      need to be done to get the target schema to the same state
      as the reference (=source) schema. XSLTs to transform this XML
      into SQL scripts will follow
Enh:  (77.19) WBIMPORT now accepts -sourcedir for XML files to import
      all .xml files in that directory. When mixing XML files with long
      and short tags this works only if the files are created with
      this build, as the information about the tags used is available
      in the meta data of the XML file.
Enh:  (77.19) WBEXPORT now accepts -sourcetable=* to export all tables
Enh:  (77.22) Two new settings to control the formatting of generated
      SQL statements:
      workbench.sql.generate.insert.doformat
	  workbench.sql.generate.update.doformat
	  If set to false generated SQL statements (INSERT, UPDATE) will always
	  be put into a single line.
Enh:  (77.27) The default behaviour when creating text files with WBEXPORT
      for writing a header line, can now be defined using the property
      workbench.export.text.default.header
      (The existing setting workbench.export.text.includeheader stores
      the last selection when the export file was created using the GUI
      rather then WBEXPORT)

Fix:  (77.1) When a table was created using lowercase in Oracle, the
      DB Explorer would not work correctly for displaying data and
      dropping the table
Fix:  (77.2) Schemas with underscores where not treated correctly when
      creating UPDATE statements for the result set
Fix:  (77.4) SELECT statements that were immediately followed by a whitespace
      other then a regular space were not detected correctly when
      exporting data.
Fix:  (77.4) "Show table data" in the DbExplorer did not always use the
      correct table definition.
Fix:  (77.5) When a file was saved with an encoding other then the default
      encoding, the encoding was not properly restored when the workspace
      was loaded again.
Fix:  (77.6) Tried to make the workspace loading more robust to avoid
      corrupted workspaces.
Fix:  (77.10) SELECT .. INTO did no longer work with Informix and Postgres
Fix:  (77.11) Sometimes connection errors where not displayed correctly
      (the application would display the "Connecting to the database..."
      message indefinitely)
Fix:  (77.11) Fixed a problem when no workspace file was defined for
      a connection profile that was introduced with 77.6
Fix:  (77.12) Fixed a uppercase/lowercase problem when using WBIMPORT
Fix:  (77.12) When the -file switched is not supplied when using WBIMPORT
      a clear error message is now given.
Fix:  (77.15) Fixed a problem with the parsing of SQL statements with comments
Fix:  When importing text files with quote characters, empty fields ("") where
      not processed correctly (the import would fail with an error)
Fix:  (77.16) When exporting data from the select SQL statement, this now blocks
      the current panel (just like executing the statement would do) to avoid
      conflicts with non-threaded JDBC drivers
Fix:  (77.17) Ctrl-Enter was still working even if the application was
      disconnected.
Fix:  (77.20) Worked around a bug in the Oracle driver which would not
      return the correct objects for Timestamp (Oracle 9) columns
Fix:  (77.22) Entering timestamp values did not work.
Fix:  (77.23) [Oracle] In the DbExplorer the name for table level check
      constraints was not included in the SQL source
Fix:  (77.24) When using -charfunc for WBEXPORT the generated SQL Statements
      were not correct if a non-printable character was immediately followed
      by another non-printable character.
Fix:  (77.25) The source for Oracle packages are now displayed correctly
Fix:  (77.28) Date columns where not exported (Clipboard, WBEXPORT) correctly
      with Oracle (the export would not use to_date())

Build 77, 12.02.2005
--------------------
Enh:  When saving a result set using "Save as", the table to be used for INSERT
      statements can now be defined. (For UPDATE also, but that requires
      the retrieval of the PK columns prior to opening the dialog)
Enh:  The usage of the NULL keyword in a CREATE TABLE statement (DbExplorer)
      can now be configured. If the DBID of the connection is listed in the
      property workbench.db.nonullkeyword then the NULL keyword will not be
      used when generating the CREATE TABLE
Enh:  When copying data to the clipboard (Text, SQL), or saving the result set
      to a file (Data -> Save Data As) the columns that should be include can
      now be selected. When copying to the clipboard the selection dialog
      is displayed when pressing the CTRL key while clicking the menu item.
Enh:  When connected to a FirebirdSQL database, the command INPUT can also be
      used to call one SQL script from another.
Enh:  A query timeout can now be defined (Whether it is really working depends
      on the capabilities of the JDBC driver)
Enh:  Selected text (or the current line) can now be commented or un-commented
      using the Shortcuts Ctrl-Shift-C (Comment) or Ctrl-Shift-U (Uncomment)
Enh:  Added a "Select all" and "Select none" button to primary key select
      dialog (when updating a table without primary key definition)
Enh:  Added support for McKoi database
Enh:  The formatting of the generated INSERT statements can now be influenced
      by setting two properties in workbench.settings:

      workbench.sql.generate.insert.newlinethreshold
      defines the number of columns in the table before any reformatting of the
      column list or values list takes place

      workbench.sql.generate.insert.colsperline
      if the INSERT statement affects more then 'newlinethreshold' columns
      this value defines the number of columns to put into a single line.
