Build @BUILD_NUMBER@, @BUILD_DATE@
--------------------
Enh:  (90.7) The type of an index (e.g. BITMAP, HASH) is now shown in the 
      DbExplorer.
Enh:  (90.4) When running SQL Workbench in batch mode, you can now omit the 
      -profile parameter. This obviously only makes sense if you run
      only WbCopy commands that specify source and target connections.
Enh:  (90.4) WbExport now can ignore missing tables (when using 
      -sourcetable=table1,table2,table3 if -continueOnError=true
Enh:  (90.2) The data in the result set can now quickly be filtered by the
      value(s) of the currently selected column(s)
Enh:  (90.2) The data can now be sorted by more then one column. To define
      additional sort columns, hold down the Ctrl key while clicking on the
      column header. To remove a secondary column hold down the Shift key
      and click on the column header.
Enh:  (90.2) WbSchemaDiff can now optionally include stored procedure
Enh:  (90.2) A new setting to control the max. text size to be put into
      the SQL history is now available:

      The default is set to 10MB
Enh:  (90.2) A new option has been added to exclude external files from 
      beeing stored in the SQL history (Tools -> Options -> Editor)
Enh:  (90.1) WbExport can now also write CLOB contents into external files
      for XML and Text export. Text exports need to be imported using WbImport 
      with the new parameter -clobIsFilename. In the XML format the external
      file is automatically recognized.
Fix:  (907) Shortcuts without a modifier (e.g. F1) could not be customized
Fix:  (90.7) More fixes to the error handling during batch processing
Fix:  (90.7) WbImport did not give a proper error message when a non-existing
      column was defined using the -importColumns parameter
Fix:  (90.6) Primary key columns were not detected correctly when the 
      column name was a (SQL92) reserved word which led to incorred
      WHERE conditions for updating the result set.
Fix:  (90.5) When creating triggers for Oracle, error messages were not 
      displayed automatically
Fix:  (90.5) Fixed some problems in the DataPumper and code-completion 
      when using table or column names that need quoting (e.g. with spaces)
Fix:  (90.4) The DataPumper now allows the setting of the batch size instead
      of simply enabling it
Fix:  (90.4) When nesting multiple WbInclude commands, the value for the 
      -continueOnError parameter was not correctly evaluated for all 
      nesting levels
Fix:  (90.4) The default value for -continueOnError for the WbInclude 
      command is now false, as stated in the documentation
Fix:  (90.4) Oracle style includes (@test.sql) were not working with 
      comments inside scripts.
Fix:  (90.3) Closing the autocompletion popup when the quicksearch is
      cancelled did not work (Property in Tools -> Optioins -> Editor)
Fix:  (90.2) Tables with mixed-case names were not handled correctly in 
      the DbExplorer
Fix:  (90.2) Auto-completion for table alias was not working correctly
      if there was no space before the alias (e.g. a.col=b.col instead
      of (a.col = b.col)
Fix:  (90.2) The indicator marking a running statement in the main window
      was cleared when switching between two panels where one was running a 
      statement and the other panel was not.
Fix:  (90.1) The table list in the DropDown of the DataPumper was sorted
      by table type rather than table name
Fix:  (90.1) When creating the target table using WbCopy or DataPumper, 
      the original column order is now maintained
Fix:  (90.1) Improved and fixed up the error handling and reporting during batch 
      execution

      window, the current value of the column was not displayed
Fix:  (90.1) Fixed some repainting problems in the editor
Fix:  (90.3) Copy as SQL was broken if edit mode was not started

Build 90, 11.10.2006
--------------------
Enh:  (89.4) The connection profile has been enhanced to include 
      SQL Statements that can be executed after a connection has been 
      established and before a connection is about to be closed.
Enh:  (89.3) The case (upper, lower, as is) for table names in generated
      SQL statements can now be set independently from the paste case
      in the editor. The new setting is available at 
      Tools->Options->SQL formatting. It defaults to the "Paste case" value for
      the editor
Enh:  (89.3) Data can now be imported from the Clipboard into the current
      result set.
Enh:  (89.2) Exporting data as SQL statements now writes the 
      SQL Workbench/J syntax for blob files and extracts the blobs as well
      (like XML and Text export)
Enh:  (89.1) You can now import only parts of a file by defining the 
      startrow and the endrow from the input file using the parameters
      -startrow and -endrow for WbImport
Enh:  (89.1) A new parameter to control commit during batch import has been 
      added: -commitBatch which is only evaluated when -batchSize is set 
      to a value greater than one. 
      If this is set to true, then after sending a batch to the server
      commit() is called. This is slightly different to using -commitEvery
      with the value of the batchSize parameter. The latter one will add
      a COMMIT statement to the batch queue, rather than calling the 
      JDBC commit() method, because some drivers do not allow a COMMIT 
      statement inside the batch queue.
Enh:  (89.1) The last saved Filter definition files are now available
      as a dropdown next to the filter icon in the toolbar. The maximum
      number of entries that are displayed in the list can be set with 
      the property workbench.gui.filter.mru.maxsize in workbench.settings
      The default is 15
Enh:  (89.1) Removed the "Disable automatic update table check" from the 
      connection profile. The PK information for the update table is now
      retrieved when needed.
Enh:  (89.1) Connection Profiles can no be moved/copied between profile groups
      using drag and drop 
Enh:  (89.1) You can now specify an alternate method of creating filenames for
      exported BLOB data, using the -blobidcols switch. The filename for the 
      blob data will then be created by using the base name of the export file,
      the column name of the BLOB column and the value(s) of the supplied
      id column(s)
Enh:  (89.1) The current cursor location of the SQL editor is now displayed
      in the status bar
Enh:  (89.1) For Oracle VARCHAR2 columns with byte or char semantics are 
      now displayed with the approriate modifier in the DbExplorer
Enh:  (89.1) The location of the tabs inside the DbExplorer can now be 
      customized with the property:
      workbench.gui.dbobjects.tabletabs=
      Valid values are: bottom, left, right, top
Enh:  (89.1) For WbImport and WbCopy the -usebatch=true parameter is no 
      longer necessary. When passing -batchsize with a value greater 
      than 1 (one) batchmode is automatically enabled.
Enh:  (89.1) New SQL tabs can now be inserted after the current tab
Fix:  (89.1) Fixed some missing labels.
Fix:  (89.1) When selecting procedures/functions inside an Oracle package
      the editor would no longer jump to the selected procedure.
Fix:  (89.1) Fixed incorrect display of triggers for Apache Derby
Fix:  (89.1) WbCopy did not report an error if any of the profiles
      or tables were not found (only a NullPointerException)
Fix:  (89.1) When switching the font in the editor, the display
      was not always correct until the application was restarted.
Fix:  (89.1) Results where not displayed correctly if a large
      font was selected for the data display
Fix:  (89.1) If no workbench.settings was present in the application 
      directory and the directory contained spaces, the application 
      would not save its settings or profiles.
Fix:  (89.1) "Generate DDL Script" in the DbExplorer was not working
      for non-table objects.
Fix:  (89.2) Fixed some bugs due to the new checking of the update table
Fix:  (89.3) Profiles could not be moved using drag & drop into an empty group
Fix:: (89.3) Quoted table names were not kept during update statement generation
      for the result set

Build 89, 08.09.2006
--------------------
Enh:  (88.23) WbImport will silently convert true/false literals 
      for integer columns into the values 1/0.
Enh:  (88.23) When generating statements internally, the auto completion paste
      case setting is also applied to table and column names
Enh:  (88.21) The encoding of the scripts in batch mode can now be specified
      on the commandline using the -encoding switch.
Enh:  (88.20) The PDF manual can now be displayed from inside 
      the application. for this to work, the path to the PDF
      reader executable has to be defined in Tools -> Options
      and SQLWorkbench-Manual.pdf needs to be available in the
      directory where workbench.jar is located.
Enh:  (88.20) Tables can now be filter out using a regular expression 
      in the DbExplorer. The default setting will remove tables from 
      Oracle 10g's recylce bin. This is controlled by the property
      workbench.db.[dbid].exclude.tables=<regex>
Enh:  (88.20) Improved the performance of the editor on large
      files (for loading and for scrolling)
Enh:  (88.19) Column widths can now be optimized automatically after 
      data is retrieved. A new option is available in 
      Tools->Options->Data editing. The column header can also be 
      included in that calculation by default.
Enh:  (88.19) When starting without a profile, the parameter 
      -rollbackOnDisconnect (with the value true/false) is now supported.
      If this is set to true, then SQL Workbench will send a rollback
      to the DBMS before closing the connection. This is already 
      available in the (GUI) connection profile.
Enh:  (88.18) When creating a DDL script from within the DbExplorer, 
      foreign key constraints are now put at the end of the script. 
Enh:  (88.17) Profile groups can now be deleted directly using the context
      menu, even if they still contain profiles.
Enh:  (88.16) Statements can be cleaned from newlines before sending 
      them to the server by using the property
      workbench.db.[dbid].removenewlines=true
      Where [dbid] should be replaced with the DBID shown in the log file
Enh:  (88.16) Every SQL Statement sent from within the editor, can now 
      be logged by setting the property:
      workbench.sql.execution.log=true
      The statements will be logged with INFO level.
Enh:  (88.16) The character sequence for a new line that is used by the 
      editor internally and for saving files can now be configured in the 
      Options dialog
Enh:  (88.16) Added support for DB2 Triggers, Alias, Stored Procedures
      Sequences and materialized query tables in the DbExplorer
Enh:  (88.15) Individual cells can now be selected in a result set by
      holding down the Alt-Key while selecting rows/columns. When using 
      "Copy selected" on such a selection, only the selected columns
      will be copied. Note that this will produce incorrect results 
      when copying SQL statements and no primary key column is part of 
      the selection.
      The modifier for rectangular selections in the editor has been 
      switched to the Alt key as well, to be consistent. 
Enh:  (88.15) When specifying a connection profile through parameters 
      (Commandline, WbCopy, WbSchemaDiff) the profile group can now 
      also be specified. Please refer to the manual for details on the new 
      parameters
Enh:  (88.14) The statement history can now be deleted by using 
      SQL -> Clear history
Enh:  (88.12) WbImport with -type=text can now handle records spanning 
      multiple lines (which need to be enclosed with the quote character)
      This support can be enabled with the parameter -multiline=true
Enh:  (88.11) A new option to use alternating colors for table rows 
      is available in the Options dialog
Enh:  (88.10) The WbImport command can now handle the compressed archives
      created with WbImport -compress=true
Enh:  (88.10) Specifying a full connection using the -url -driver, ... 
      parameters is now also possible when not running in batch mode, 
      so a connection can be established without an existing profile for GUI 
      mode. A new commandline parameter -workspace is also available to 
      a workspace file to be used. (The file name can contain the 
      %ConfigDir% placeholder)
Enh:  (88.7) Stored procedures for Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise are 
      now displayed correctly.
Enh:  (88.6) If neither the -header nor the -filecolumns parameter are 
      specified for the WbImport command, SQL Workbench/J assumes the 
      file matches the table definition.
Enh:  (88.6) All settings that are available in workbench.settings can now 
      be overwritten on the commandline using -Dworkbench.settings...=
Enh:  (88.6) Writing the settings when closing the application can now 
      be prevented by passing the -nosettings parameter to the application
Enh:  (88.6) The connection profiles can now be grouped. The list on the
      left side of the connection dialog is now displayed as a Tree.
Enh:  (88.1) The table lists in the DataPumper can now be refreshed 
      without re-connecting
Enh:  (88.1) BLOB columns can now be set to NULL from within the BLOB Dialog
Enh:  (88.1) Text export and import can now handle BLOB data as well. The
      text file will contain the file name of the external file to which 
      the blob was written. WbImport will automatically assume the value
      of blob columns are filenames (this can be turned off with 
      the parameter -blobisfilename=false when running WbImport) 
      When writing Oracle SQL*Loader control files (-writeoracleloader=true 
      for WbExport), the control file will include the necessary definitions
      to import the blob from the external file.
Enh:  (88.1) WbSelectBlob now processes the full result set (and not 
      only the first row. Subsequent files will be name as the 
      base file with _(n) appended, where (n) is the row number 
      as retrieved from the DBMS server.
Fix:  (88.1) With Firebird, SELECT statements were broken
Fix:  (88.2) With Oracle CLOBs where always written with CDATA tags when 
      using XML Export even if -usecdata was set to false
Fix:  (88.4) For non-character columns, WbImport now treats empty values or 
      values that only consist of whitespace as null values (instead 
      of throwing an error) 
Fix:  (88.4) When saving a result set to a file "Save Data as", nothing 
      was written, if no file extension was specified.
Fix:  (88.6) The DbExplorer was not working as a standalone application any 
      longer (using the -dbexplorer switch or DbExplorer.exe)
Fix:  (88.11) "Save Workspace as..." was not working when no extension
      was specified
Fix:  (88.11) When enabling DBMS_OUTPUT (on Oracle) LONG or LONG RAW columns
      could not be retrieved as well. DbExplorer and DataPumper now disable
      DBMS_OUTPUT as soon as they connect. For regular SELECTs in the 
      editor tabs, this has to be done manually by the user by either
      globally disabling DBMS_OUTPUT in the options dialog or through
      DISABLEOUT before running a query on a table with a LONG column.
Fix:  (88.13) When switching from one Workspace with a file in a tab to 
      another workspace with not file in the same tab location, the file 
      was not unloaded.
Fix:  (88.13) WbImport did not use the -encoding parameter
Fix:  (88.14) When using SQL Workbench in batch mode without a 
      WbDrivers.xml, connections through the ODBC bridge did not work
Fix:  (88.15) When copying a profile from one group to another using
      the context menu, the new profile was not saved.
Fix:  (88.18) After reformatting the SQL Ctrl-Z (Undo) needed to be pressed
      twice in order to undo the reformatting.
Fix:  (88.18) If the internal line ending was set to something else then Unix
      loading external files would not work properly 
Fix:  (88.19) WbImport always used a quote character ("), even if no
      quote character was specified (so it was not possible to run 
      an import without any tests on quotes)
Fix:  (88.19) Re-introduced fix to prevent sending another SQL Statement while a 
      WbExport is running
Fix:  (88.20) The automatic retrieval of key columns for the target table 
      was not working for the WbCopy command.
Fix:  (88.21) -importcolumn parameter was not working for WbImport
Fix:  (88.21) Fixed repainting problems in editor
Fix:  (88.21) The DbExplorer could not be closed any longer, if only on SQL Tab 
      was open
Fix:  (88.21) Fixed the progress display in the console for Linux

      tools can be defined in the Options dialog 
      (Tools -> Options -> External Tools)
Enh:  (87.7) WbSchemaDiff now supports the -useJdbcTypes parameter which will
      compare the JDBC data types of the columns not the DBMS specific 
      data types to make a comparison of schemas across different DBMS 
      a bit more general.
Enh:  (87.4) When displaying the source for a Stored Procedure, View or Table
      in the DbExplorer the source can now be opened in an editor tab.
Enh:  (87.4) Made processing of result sets more flexible when running 
      multiple SQL statements that are not separated with a semicolon 
      (e.g. with SQL Server accepts this non-standard syntax)
Enh:  (87.3) "Create empty INSERT" in the DbExplorer now uses the formatting
      settings for internally generated statements.
Enh:  (87.3) "Create empty INSERT" can now be configured to use ? for the 
      values to help make creating PreparedStatements in Java code.
      This is controlled through the property
      workbench.sql.generate.defaultinsert.prepared=true
      in workbench.settings
Fix:  (87.3) Saving variables from within the WbVarList result was broken
Fix:  (87.3) When the source table was not found for the WbCopy command
      it was incorrectly reported as "Target table not found"
Fix:  (87.3) When switching result set tabs (inside a single panel) while
      editing a column, the new result tab(s) got corrupted.
Fix:  (87.3) When selecting from a different database with SQL Server
      the generated UPDATE statements did not include the 
      database
Fix:  (87.5) Cancelling a SELECT statement during processing of the 
      result was broken.
Fix:  (87.6) When running in batch mode, WbInclude (and other commands)

      always using the current directory.
Fix:  (87.7) When using -referenceTables and -targetTables at the same time
      WbSchemaDiff did not report differences properly.
Fix:  (87.8) When a file is loaded in the editor, the file's directory 
      is used as the base directory for subsequent includes when running 
      the Script. Thanks to Christian d'Heureuse for this fix.
Fix:  (87.8) Prompting from within scripts that are called using wbinclude
      now works properly (when running in GUI mode)
Fix:  (87.8) When using a TAB character to separate the table name from the 
      table alias, auto-completion did not recognize the table
Fix:  (87.8) When a column is directky prefixed with a comma, auto-completion 
      was not working properly.
Fix:  (87.9) Statements using MS SQL Server's outer join syntax (using *=) 
      were not reformatted correctly.
Fix:  (87.9) Fixed some problems when re-formatting subselects
Fix:  (87.9) The USE command was broken with SQL Server when using
      quoted DB Names (e.g. [otherdb] or "otherdb")
      The usage of the setCatalog() function can be disabled using the property
      workbench.db.[dbid].usesetcatalog=false
Fix:  (87.10) When modifying a newly inserted row in the result that has already
      been saved, modified columns were not always detected correctly
Fix:  (87.11) Sub-selects in the WHERE clause where not formatted correctly      
      if the sub-selected used = instead of IN

      statements were executed)
Fix:  (87.13) The display for start and end row was not always correct.
Fix:  (87.15) Switching between result sets in the same SQL panel would 
      discard any changes in done in the result set
      
Build 87, 08.05.2006
--------------------
Fix:  Some Workbench specific statements were broken when entered in lowercase

Build 85, 07.05.2006
--------------------
Enh:  (85.7) "Expand Editor" and "Expand Result" now act as a toggle. 
      The first time they are invoked they will expand the editor (or the
      result area) the second time they will undo the expand. 
      The "Undo Expand" will undo the last expand.
Enh:  (85.2) Reworked the Options dialog
Enh:  (85.9) The connection profile has a new attribute "Remove comments" which 
      is disabled by default. If enbled, any comments will be removed
      from the SQL statement before sending it to the server
Enh:  (85.14) Support for multiple result sets. This includes a change in the 
      display of the results. The result tab in the lower pane will not be 
      displayed unless the last SQL statement actually did produce a
      result set
Enh:  (85.14) Incremental search ("Search as you type") in auto completion
Enh:  (85.17) When using the auto completion in a GROUP BY the columns
      from the select list are now displayed
Enh:  (85.19) Added more properties to the options dialog
Enh:  (85.27) When undoing in the editor, the cursor now moves to the

      when connected to SQL Server (or any DBMS that supports catalogs)
Enh:  (85.38) BLOB columns are now displayed with a button that 
      will open a dialog to either save the blob or display it as
      text or an image. Files can also be "uploaded" from within
      that dialog.
Enh:  (85.39) If a macro definition contains the string ${selection}$ it 
      will be replaced with the selected text in the current editor. 
      If the definition contains the string ${current_statement}$ it will be 
      replaced with the sql statement at the cursor location.
      The replacement keys are case-sensitiv. 
Enh:  (85.43) Moved the "Remember DbExplorer Schema" option from the 
      global options to the profile options.
Enh:  (85.43) Additional Look & Feels can now be defined through the

      not always show the error.
Fix:  (85.7) The Options dialog would not open on a new installation
Fix:  (85.10) CLOB columns where not exported correctly for XML exports
Fix:  (85.16) When using "Save Data as" the options from the dialog
      where not correctly applied to the export file
Fix:  (85.19) Code completion inside a subselect was not working properly 
      if a statement contained more then one subselect
Fix:  (85.21) -commitevery was not working for WbImport if -usebatch was
      used (Thanks to Pascal for reporting this and also supplying the fix)
Fix:  (85.24) When using "Autojump to next statement" the result tab was 
      not selected when executing the last statement in the editor (using 
      "Execute Current"). 
Fix:  (85.25) Code completion was not working properly for statements 
      using the "new" JOIN syntax
Fix:  (85.29) Single line commands (such as SET SPOOL OFF) without a
      delimiter are now only detected when connected with an Oracle
      database. To (re-)enable this feature for other database systems
      add the DBID for your DBMS to the setting
      workbench.db.checksinglelinecmd
Fix:  (85.32) DESC dbname.owner.tablename was not working for SQL Server
Fix:  (85.34) Stored procedures where not displayed for SQL Server 
      when using multiple databases.
Fix:  (85.37) The USE command did not work with MySQL. This is actually 
      a "feature" of the MySQL driver which does not allow to change 
      the database with the USE command, only through Connection.setCatalog()
      which is now used internally by when a "USE dbname" is executed
Fix:  (85.38) WbVarDef was not working properly if a space was put around
      the equal sign (e.g. WbVarDef function_code = 1)
Fix:  (85.38) Time columns were not displayed correctly.
Fix:  (85.39) Detection of table alias for code completion 
      was not working properly any more
Fix:  (85.41) The application was not starting any more if no -configdir 
      was passed
Fix:  (85.43) The available tables were not recognized properly if 
      more then one JOIN was used.
Fix:  (85.45) The result of stored procedures that returned ResultSets 
      and updateCounts where not processed correctly
Fix:  (85.46) Update counts were sometimes reported twice
Fix:  (85.46) When trying to update a result based on a SELECT statement 
      with multiple tables, the tables were not listed correctly in the 
      dialog
Fix:  ALTER TABLE ... DROP CONSTRAINT was not considered for the "Ignore
      DROP errors" option. (Thanks, Janek for this)
Fix:  Statements immediately following a combination of multi-line and 
      single line statements were not always detected correctly and 
      thus not considered e.g. for the "Ignore DROP errors" option

Build 85, 20.02.2006
--------------------
Enh:  (84.2) The automatic scroll area of the editor ("electric scroll") can 
      now be configured with the property workbench.editor.electricscroll and 
      defines the number of lines where the electric scrolling should be 
      enabled. The current default is 3. This property can also be set
      through the options dialog ("Editor" tab)
      
      The color used to highlight statements that failed can now be configured 
      with the setting workbench.editor.color.error
      
Fix:  (84.1) When no profile was selected in the connect dialog, the OK button 
      could still be clicked (without result). Additionally if no profile 
      was selected, profile information could still be entered but would be lost
      when switching the profile
Fix:  (84.4) Code completion was not always working with subselects
Fix:  (84.4) WbSchemaDiff was not working any longer (due to the rename from 
      WbDiff
      
Build 84, 10.02.2006
--------------------
Enh:  (83.3) The number of columns the formatter ("Reformat SQL" menu item) puts
      into one line of a SELECT list, can now be defined:
      workbench.sql.formatter.select.columnsperline=1
Enh:  (83.2) When creating insert statements, columns defined as identity columns 
      are now ignored. This behaviour can be disabled (i.e. switch back to the 
      old way) by setting
      workbench.sql.generate.insert.ignoreidentity=false
Enh:  (83.7) Added the ability to define primary key columns for tables and views. 
      This can either be done using the new "WbDefinPk" command, or by defining 
      a mapping file that contains the definitions. The name of the mapping file 
      (which has to be a standard Java properties file with table=col1,col2 
      entries) can be defined in workbench.settings using
      workbench.pkmapping.file=filename
      The new commands to control this additional PK settings are:
      WbDefinePk - Define a PK mapping for one table
      WbListPkDef - List the currently active PK mapping
      WbLoadPkMap - Load a PK mapping from an external file
      WbSavePKMap - Save the current mapping to an external file
Enh:  (83.8) The way empty strings are treated and whether columns containing NULL
      values are included in INSERT statements can now be controlled in the 
      connection profile
Enh:  (83.9) Import progress (and other progress messages from the statusbar) can 
      now be enabled in the commandline (batch execution) with the parameter
      -showprogress=true
      As Java's support for the console is very limited this might not work
      properly in all situations
Enh:  (83.14) When displaying source for Oracle packaged functions, the editor
      not scrolls to the function.
Enh:  (83.14) The column header's tooltip now contains the datatype
Enh:  (83.15) WbImport now supports creating the target table if the import file
      is an XML file (-createtarget=true)
Enh:  (83.16) For Oracle the DESC command now also works for DBLinks (e.g. 
      desc table@dblink)
Enh:  (83.16) The path to the driver jar files can now contain the placeholder
       %LibDir%. The libdir can be specified in workbench.settings or using 
      the new command line -libdir
Enh:  (83.19) DbExplorers opened as a tab will store the selected schema in the 
      current workspace. This behavior can be disabled (old way) by setting
      workbench.dbexplorer.rememberSchema=false in workbench.settings
Enh:  WbDiff has been renamed to WbSchemaDiff 

Fix:  (83.1) The shortcut @ for the WbInclude command is now only supported for 
      Oracle because e.g. SQL Server uses the @ sign to name procedure 
      parameters (and thus existing scripts do not work). 
Fix:  (83.2) Correct handling of MS SQL Server's BIT datatype when creating
      SQL statements.
Fix:  (83.3) Workaround for a bug in the Postgres JDBC driver which would 
      not show tables in the DbExplorer for the schemas pg_catalog and 
      information_schema
Fix:  (83.6) Minor bugfixes to the code completion
Fix:  (83.8) The defined date and timestamp format (Options) was not used
      when parsing dates entered.
Fix:  (83.10) Copying data as SQL statements was broken
Fix:  (83.10) FK Constraints were not compared correctly in the WbDiff command
Fix:  (83.11) Prevent sending another SQL Statement while a WbExport is running
Fix:  (83.12) Auto-completion was not working properly inside function calls
Fix:  (83.13) Copying selected data as SQL statements was broken
Fix:  (83.14) The SQL Formatter treats != as an operator (and does not separate
      the two characters)
Fix:  (83.19) A schema change (e.g. in Oracle via ALTER SESSION) was not always
      reflected in the connection info
Fix:  (83.22) WbExport did not export blob columns correctly when writing XML files
Fix:  (83.23) When creating procedures or functions in Oracle, the error information
      was not always displayed correctly.
Fix:  (83.25) When "Retrieve DbExplorer" was not enabled in the options dialog, 
      the schema dropdown was never populated in the DbExplorer
Fix:  (83.26) Displaying table structure in DbExplorer was broken with Oracle 8i
Fix:  (83.28) "Replace all" was not working with "Ignore case" in the editor
