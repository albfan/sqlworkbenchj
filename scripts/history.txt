Build 101, 13.09.2008
--------------------
Enh:  (100.9) Made WbSchemaDiff a bit more "robust" when comparing schemas
      from different DBMS
Enh:  (100.9) When displaying the source for a view, grants given on that view
      are now also displayed for Postgres, Oracle, HSQLDB, H2, MySQL, Firebird
      DB2, Derby and SQL Server
Enh:  (100.8) A new option (Options -> Data Editing) is available to warn
      when a result set with changes will be discarded (e.g. when running a
      new SELECT while changes to the current result have not been saved)
Enh:  (100.7) The DataPumper table dropdown now displays Excel Worksheets
Enh:  (100.6) A new option for WbSchemaDiff is available that treats views from
      the reference schema just like tables, and compares them to corresponding
      tables in the target schema.
Enh:  (100.6) A new option to automatically optimize the individual row heights
      to match possible multi-line values is available. This can be applied
      automatically after the retrieval of the data, or manually using
      View -> Optimize Row Height (or the popup menu on the column header)
Enh:  (100.5) The parameter -trimValues for WbImport can now also be used
      for XML imports.
Enh:  (100.4) A new parameter -rowNumberColumn is available for text exports
      that can be used to generate a column with the current row number.
      If the parameter is specified with a value, the value defines the name
      of the additional column. If the text file is not created with
      a header a value for the rowNumberColumn must still be given to enable
      the creation of the additional column. The row number will always be
      exported as the first column.
Enh:  (100.4) A new parameter -excludeFiles is available for WbImport when
      using the -sourceDir switch. With this parameter, files can be excluded
      while processing the contents of the directory. The value is a comma
      separated list of (partial) file names. Any filename that contains one
      of the values will be ignored.
Enh:  (100.4) A new parameter -ignoreOwner is available for WbImport. In case
      export files have been created including the owner information (e.g.
      myschema.person.txt) the owner can now be ignored when importing files
      from a sourcedirectory.
Enh:  (100.4) -quiet has been removed, and is now included with the
      -feedback=true parameter.
Enh:  (100.3) The display of warnings can now be surpressed. This can be set
      in the connection profile, as a parameter when connecting in batch mode
      (-hideWarnings=true) or using the new command WbHideWarnings [true|false]
Enh:  (100.3) The usage of the generic execute() method when running select
      statements can now be enabled (instead of using executeQuery()) using
      the property: workbench.db.select.genericexecute=true in the file
      workbench.settings
Enh:  (100.3) A new parameter -quiet can be specified in batch mode, that
      will surpress some informational messages that are not surpressed
      when using -feedback=false (or WbFeedback off).
Enh:  (100.2) WbConnect can now be used in GUI mode as well. It will only
      change the connection as long as the current script is running. The
      "global" connection will be restored, once the script has finished.
Enh:  (100.2) The number of columns that are put on a single line when
      reformatting statements can now also be adjusted for UPDATE and INSERT
      statements.
Enh:  (100.1) The margins used to render data can now be configured using
      the property workbench.gui.renderer.insets
      The property value is a comma separated list of integer values to define
      the top,left,bottom,right insets for a single data cell.
Enh:  (100.1) CHECK constraints were not generated in the DbExplorer for DB2
Enh:  (100.1) A new command WbDataDiff has been added which compares the
      data of one (or more tables) and creates approriate scripts to
      update the data of the target table to be the same as the reference
      table.
Enh:  (100.1) The default encoding (when no encoding is given) for the WbInclude
      command can now be configured using the property workbench.encoding
      The default is displayed when WbInclude is run without parameters.
Fix:  (100.9) The table reference navigation created wrong SQL statements if
      the same table was referenced through more than one foreign key reference.
Fix:  (100.9) On Linux with the GTK Look and Feel the focus was not set to the
      "Select connection" window upon startup.
Fix:  (100.9) WbInclude would fail if no connection was available (e.g. because
      the included script would make the connection)
Fix:  (100.8) Re-assigning a Shortcut was only activated after restarting
      the application.
Fix:  (100.8) Display of text columns should now work for Informix
Fix:  (100.7) WbExport did not escape the content of columns correctly.
      Previously the escaping was only done for character data, now it's done
      for all data types (unless -useCDATA is specified).
Fix:  (100.7) "Check table dependencies" did not always work correctly for
      deleting tables, when one of the selected tables was also a child
      of one of the tables that were added during FK checking and that table
      was a self-referencing table.
Fix:  (100.7) WbSchemaDiff did not release the connections properly.
Fix:  (100.7) The row height was not retained when editing values in the
      result set or applying a filter
Fix:  (100.6) Calling stored procedures with output parameters was not working
      properly, especially when regular parameters were needed as well.
Fix:  (100.6) Tried to make retrieval in the DbExplorer more robust agains
      hanging connections.
Fix:  (100.5) In some cases WbInclude would fail processing a script.
Fix:  (100.5) When using -append=true and -createTable=true for SQL Exports
      the CREATE TABLE was not written (appended) to the output file (because
      WbExport would never write the "header" for an export that appends to
      an existing file, which does not make sense for SQL INSERT exports.
Fix:  (100.4) When importing a directory using -sourceDir, WbImport would
      treat the files containing tables lobs as regular table files e.g.
      searching for a table mytable_lobs.
Fix:  (100.4) Resolving table dependencies for INSERT (WbImport) or DELETE
      did not work if the list of tables contained a self-referencing table
      that was referenced by another (parent) table.
Fix:  (100.4) A change to the driver for a connection profile was not detected
      as a change, so the user was not asked to save the profiles when stopping
      the application
Fix:  (100.3) The toolbar was not always correctly repainted when a workspace
      was closed
Fix:  (100.3) When "Autosave Workspace" was enabled and the workspace contained
      an external file, the user was prompted if the file should be saved
      each time a statement was executed. Now the external file is automatically
      saved as well, when the workspace is saved.
Fix:  (100.3) When a script ended with a statement that had a dangling
      single quote, the last (incorrect) statement was not executed at all
Fix:  (100.3) Common Table Expressions (WITH ... AS ...) were not formatted
      correctly.
Fix:  (100.3) "Copy data to clipboard" was not always enabled, even if a
      result set was available.
Fix:  (100.2) When using "Search table data" in the DbExplorer, the connection
      profile attribute "Trim CHAR data" were not used to retrieve the data.
Fix:  (100.2) The SQL source for sequences was no longer displayed.
Fix:  (100.2) The application did not always ask to save the connection
      profiles even if they were modified
Fix:  (100.2) Triggers were not displayed for DB2 when the server was running
      on 64bit Windows
Fix:  (100.2) When changing the the current database in the DbExplorer
      in MySQL, updating the data did not work, because the table
      in the update statement was not fully qualified (to include the
      database name)
Fix:  (100.1) The Option "Map Oracle DATE to Timestamp" was only applied
      when restarting the application
Fix:  (100.1) WbExport's XML format now defaults to XML 1.0 again. An option
      has been added for WbExport to select version 1.1 if that is needed
      in order to use the newly allowed characters. XML 1.1 support
      can be enabled using -xmlVersion=1.1
      The default can be set with the property workbench.xml.default.version
Fix:  (100.1) Using WbInclude with a multi-byte characterset (e.g. UTF8)
      did not work properly
Fix:  (100.1) The WHEN condition for Oracle triggers was not displayed in the
      SQL source. Thanks to Marcel for the fix.
Fix:  (100.1) WbInclude did not give a proper error message if the specified
      file was not found.

      The individual FK references per column are still present
Enh:  (99.7) The execution of connect scripts is now also logged when
      switching to a tab and a new connection is created.
Enh:  (99.6) WbImport can now import multiple files from a source directory

      files from the source directory are imported into the target table.
      Note that -deleteTarget does not work in this mode.
Enh:  (99.6) The "Drop Tables" dialog in the DbExplorer can now sort the
      tables according to their FK references in order to allow dropping

Build 99, 01.03.2008
--------------------
Enh:  (98.6) Files generated by WbExport are now always lowercase
Enh:  (98.6) When running in batch mode, individual update counts can now
      be consolidated into a single message at the end (similar to the
      "Consolidate script log" in the GUI) using the new parameter
      -consolidateMessages=true

      define a connection as the commandline. The command will be ignored
      when running the GUI.
Fix:  (98.5) The DbExplorer panel now remembers the focused component when
      switching tabs.

      the options dialog
Enh:  (97.7) The "Extended Properties" button in the connection dialog
      will now display a little checkmark if properties are defined for
      the currently selected profile
Enh:  (97.7) Errors during retrieval of the data can now be ignored. The
      application will use NULL for these columns instead. This can be
      enabled by setting the property:
      workbench.db.ignore.readerror=true
      in workbench.settings.
Enh:  (97.7) Columns can now be searched for from the table header popup
      If the column is found, the display is scrolled to display
      that column. The search is done on partial matches. The first
      column where the entered value is found somewhere in the column
      name is displayed.
Enh:  (97.7) When searching in table data, all found values can now be
      highlighted.
Enh:  (97.7) When saving a result set to a text file, the decimal character
      could not be defined (the default from the options panel was used)
Enh:  (97.6) The current line in the editor can how be highlighted
Enh:  (97.6) A background color to indicate null values in the
      result set can now be defined
Enh:  (97.6) a new parameter for WbCopy and WbImport has been added:
      -transactionControl. It defaults to true. If set to false
      no commit or rollback will be sent to the DBMS after the import
      has finished. If savepoints are enabled they are still used
      during the import (or copy) process
Enh:  (97.6) More detailed information about the DBMS and the driver
      is now available from the context menu of the connection information
      in the toolbar.
Enh:  (97.4) When exporting a table with BLOB columns the filename to
      be used for the BLOB files can now be defined through a column
      of the result set using -filenameColumn=col_name.
      This will only make sense when exporting a table with exactly
      one BLOB column.
Enh:  (97.4) WbImport and WbCopy now support the -preTableStatement and
      the -postTableStatement to define (a single) SQL statement to
      be execute before an import into a table starts and after inserting
      into that table is finished.
Enh:  (97.3) WbImport (an WbCopy) will now ignore the -deleteTarget or
      -truncateTarget option if the selected mode is not INSERT (to
      prevent accidental deletion of records if e.g. update mode
      is selected)
Enh:  (97.3) If no config directory is supplied and no settings file
      is found in either the current directory or the directory where
      the jar file is located, the settings are now written to the
      user's home directory (in the sub-directory .sqlworkbench).
      For a new installation this means that the configuration settings
      are no longer stored in the program's directory.
Enh:  (97.3) The HTML version of the manual is now displayed using
      an external browser rather than using the built-in HTML display.
Enh:  (97.2) Highlighting the control that has the focus in the DbExplorer
      can now be enabled by setting the property:
      workbench.gui.dbobjects.showfocus=true
      This is disabled by default.
      The default color for the focus border is yellow, the color can be
      configured using the property:
      workbench.gui.focusindicator.bordercolor
      with the RGB value (e.g. 128,128,128) for the desired color.
Enh:  (97.1) For Oracle, REF CURSORS as out parameters in Procedures are now
      supported through WbCall, e.g: WbCall ref_cursor_example(42, ?);
Enh:  (97.1) You can now assign a shortcut to the reload buttons in the
      DbExplorer. The shortcut will only work if the component does have
      the focus.
Fix:  (97.10) Null values for numeric columns could not be imported into an
      Access database.
Fix:  (97.10) After moving editor-tabs the menus were no longer working correctly.
Fix:  (97.10) Table definitions could not always retrieved when using Oracle
      (e.g. in the DbExplorer)
Fix:  (97.9) Indexes with complex expressions (e.g. CASE ...) where not
      displayed correctly in the generated SQL for a table
Fix:  (97.9) The label in the DbExplorer panels "REFERENCES" and
      "REFERENCED BY" were the wrong way round.
Fix:  (97.8) Character literals spanning multiple lines were not colored
      correctly (especially if the start was not visible)
Fix:  (97.8) Using WbVardef without a value did not delete the variable.
Fix:  (97.8) When using WbCopy with a column mapping and the -createTarget
      parameter the target table could not be created due to an error
      in the generated SQL.
Fix:  (97.7) When opening several new panels very quickly the application
      could lock.
Fix:  (97.7) The application could not be started in batch mode without
      supplying a connection (either through the commandline or using
      a profile).
Fix:  (97.6) When importing integer numbers using WbImport numbers with
      scientific notation could not be imported even if they were "real"
      integer values (e.g. 4.2E+1).
Fix:  (97.5) Referencing the input file for WbImport using relative files
      paths was broken.
Fix:  (97.5) When opening and closing multiple windows (File -> Open New Window)
      and using separate connections per tab, sometimes the wrong connections
      were closed.
Fix:  (97.4) The path for a Look & Feel library was not saved, when it
      was edited manually (instead of using the file-open dialog)
Fix:  (97.4) The new parameter -checkDependencies was not working correctly
      for large schemas with deeply nested foreign keys.
Fix:  (97.4) Sequence definitions were not retrieved correctly for HSQLDB
Fix:  (97.2) The "What's New" dialog was no longer displayed.
Fix:  (97.2) The update check did not always find a new version
Fix:  (97.1) When using an old JDBC driver that did not implement savepoints
      WbImport was not working even if the usage of savepoints was turned off
Fix:  (97.1) Scripts for MySQL using non-standard line comments (with #) were
      not executed correctly.
Fix:  (97.1) The toolbar button for "Append results" did not reflect the current
      setting of this option. Only the menu item in the SQL menu did.
