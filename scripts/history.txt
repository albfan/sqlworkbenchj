                shortcuts as Mozilla)
           End: Changed data in the DbExplorer could not be saved.

12.08.2003 Fix: When the default workspace has only one statement tab, and the DbExplorer 
Build 57        was shown as a tab, the statement tab would disappear after loading the 
                workspace (thanks for catching that Patrick!)
           Enh: Added Ctrl-B shortcut to jump to the location of the matching bracket

                for some statements
                
19.07.2003 Enh: The help file is now included in Workbench.jar, thus the Help 
Build 56        menu does not try to display the internet page any longer.
                Displaying the "plain" HTML file is a workaround, until the full
                JavaHelp is available
                
19.07.2003 Fix: The data for PUBLIC synonyms in Oracle would not be displayed

           Fix: The "Ignore DROP errors" attribute for a connection was always (implicitly) stored as 
                enabled. Unfortunately the fix means that this attribute needs to be re-enabled for
                old profiles.
           Enh: It's now possible to define "Macros". A simple alias for a lengthy SQL
                statement. The macros are available under SQL/SQL Macros

           Enh: The data tab in the DbExplorer is now using the same component as the SQL panel
                in the main window, thus the max row setting moved to the lower right corner

                Workspace features
           Fix: When closing the workbench while a statement which cannot be cancelled
                is running, the application can now be closed gracefully
           Enh: The application identifies itself now in the connection properties for 
                Oracle and SQL Server (session output from v$session or sp_who2 will 
                show SQL Workbench/J as the application name)
                
17.06.2003 Fix: When loading workspaces where a script file was open, they were not restored
Build 53        correctly
           Fix: When closing a tab in a workspace, the following tabs would not keep their 
                correct names if they had a non standard name
           Fix: Fixed a bug when the alternate delimiter was set to / and the 
                script contained C-Style comments with /* ... */
           Fix: Leading spaces where strippped of the SQL Statements when loaded 
                from a workspace
           Fix: The table searcher now works with Oracle synonyms (the searcher replaces 
                the synonym name with the real table name)
           Enh: The table search now shows the SQL Statements executed in a separate
                editor pane as a refernce

                - Text selection and cursor position is now stored in the workspace as well
           Enh: Data can now be exported to XML as well
           Enh: Improved SQL History handling (selection and cursor position are stored
                and maintained)

                getSchemaTerm(), getCatalogTerm() or getProductName()
           Fix: When closing the main window with the close button in the window title bar
                and profiles where changed, the application was exited even if Cancel 
                was selected from the message box
           Enh: When importing text files, the number format and the quote character can 
                now be specified

           Enh: When switching to the data tab in the DbExplorer, the retrieval of the data
                can be prevent if the shift button is hold down, when switching the tab. 
                Even if "Automatic retrieve" is activated.
                
                The data display can also be configured to show a warning when retrieving more
                then a specific number of rows (independently of the max rows setting)

           Enh: Documented the DbExplorer's data tab (and its settings)

           Fix: The spool command didn't work anymore

                a dialog window where large amounts of text can be edited easier.

18.01.2003 Fix: Changed the format of the SQL Statement history files to plain text
                for performance reasons. Starting the workbench with a large 
                statement history would cause longer startup times due to the XML#
                parsing. Existing XML files will be automatically converted and 
                deleted.
           Fix: Optimize column width shrinks columns with no values at all, as much 
                as possible

16.01.2003 Fix: Enhance handling of huge script files
           Fix: Running multiple statements could not be cancelled.

                (thus causing an error)

15.01.2003 Enh: The command DESCRIBE is now also recognized as (not only DESC)
           Fix: Running a stored procedure with exec did not work in Oracle
           
09.01.2003 Enh: Support old style shortcuts Ctrl-Shift, Ctrl-Insert and Shift-Delete
                for copy & paste in the result table.

                set would take ages
           Fix: Fixed a bug with the delete script generation, when the table contained
                numeric columns
           Fix: Fixed a bug with the display of decimal columns
           
04.12.2002 Enh: Oracle Synonyms are now displayed correctly in the DbExplorer

                SQL execution.

                        the statement would fail with an "Out of memory exception"
                        This was caused by bug in Oracle's JDBC driver not conforming 
                        to the JDBC spec
           Fix: Oracle: The source for procedures defined in a package was not displayed.
                        Due to the way oracle stores this procedures the whole 
                        package source is now displayed

12.11.2002 Enh: New option, not to store the password for a connection profile
           Enh: Display the Java version in the about box.

                delete all depending objects as well.
                
21.10.2002 Enh: Added a "Drop" item to the context menus in the Db Explorer
           
           Fix: Fixed some bugs with checking if profiles were changed

16.10.2002 Enh: The "Search tables" feature now displays the results in tables instead

           Enh: Put the "File/Open" and "File/Discard" menu items in the popup
