Build @BUILD_NUMBER@, @BUILD_DATE@
---------------------
Enh:  (100.9) Made WbSchemaDiff a bit more "robust" when comparing schemas
      from different DBMS
Enh:  (100.9) When displaying the source for a view, grants given on that view
      are now also displayed for Postgres, Oracle, HSQLDB, H2, MySQL, Firebird
      DB2, Derby and SQL Server
Enh:  (100.8) A new option (Options -> Data Editing) is available to warn
      when a result set with changes will be discarded (e.g. when running a
      new SELECT while changes to the current result have not been saved)
Enh:  (100.7) The DataPumper table dropdown now displays Excel Worksheets
Enh:  (100.6) A new option for WbSchemaDiff is available that treats views from
      the reference schema just like tables, and compares them to corresponding
      tables in the target schema.
Enh:  (100.6) A new option to automatically optimize the individual row heights
      to match possible multi-line values is available. This can be applied 
      automatically after the retrieval of the data, or manually using 
      View -> Optimize Row Height (or the popup menu on the column header)
Enh:  (100.5) The parameter -trimValues for WbImport can now also be used
      for XML imports.
Enh:  (100.4) A new parameter -rowNumberColumn is available for text exports
      that can be used to generate a column with the current row number.
      If the parameter is specified with a value, the value defines the name
      of the additional column. If the text file is not created with
      a header a value for the rowNumberColumn must still be given to enable
      the creation of the additional column. The row number will always be
      exported as the first column.
Enh:  (100.4) A new parameter -excludeFiles is available for WbImport when 
      using the -sourceDir switch. With this parameter, files can be excluded
      while processing the contents of the directory. The value is a comma
      separated list of (partial) file names. Any filename that contains one
      of the values will be ignored.
Enh:  (100.4) A new parameter -ignoreOwner is available for WbImport. In case
      export files have been created including the owner information (e.g. 
      myschema.person.txt) the owner can now be ignored when importing files
      from a sourcedirectory.
Enh:  (100.4) -quiet has been removed, and is now included with the 
      -feedback=true parameter.
Enh:  (100.3) The display of warnings can now be surpressed. This can be set
      in the connection profile, as a parameter when connecting in batch mode
      (-hideWarnings=true) or using the new command WbHideWarnings [true|false]
Enh:  (100.3) The usage of the generic execute() method when running select
      statements can now be enabled (instead of using executeQuery()) using
      the property: workbench.db.select.genericexecute=true in the file
      workbench.settings
Enh:  (100.3) A new parameter -quiet can be specified in batch mode, that
      will surpress some informational messages that are not surpressed
      when using -feedback=false (or WbFeedback off).
Enh:  (100.2) WbConnect can now be used in GUI mode as well. It will only
      change the connection as long as the current script is running. The
      "global" connection will be restored, once the script has finished.
Enh:  (100.2) The number of columns that are put on a single line when
      reformatting statements can now also be adjusted for UPDATE and INSERT
      statements.
Enh:  (100.1) The margins used to render data can now be configured using 
      the property workbench.gui.renderer.insets
      The property value is a comma separated list of integer values to define
      the top,left,bottom,right insets for a single data cell.
Enh:  (100.1) CHECK constraints were not generated in the DbExplorer for DB2 
Enh:  (100.1) A new command WbDataDiff has been added which compares the 
      data of one (or more tables) and creates approriate scripts to 
      update the data of the target table to be the same as the reference
      table.
Enh:  (100.1) The default encoding (when no encoding is given) for the WbInclude 
      command can now be configured using the property workbench.encoding
      The default is displayed when WbInclude is run without parameters.
Fix:  (100.9) The table reference navigation created wrong SQL statements if
      the same table was referenced through more than one foreign key reference.
Fix:  (100.9) On Linux with the GTK Look and Feel the focus was not set to the
      "Select connection" window upon startup.
Fix:  (100.9) WbInclude would fail if no connection was available (e.g. because
      the included script would make the connection)
Fix:  (100.8) Re-assigning a Shortcut was only activated after restarting 
      the application.
Fix:  (100.8) Display of text columns should now work for Informix
Fix:  (100.7) WbExport did not escape the content of columns correctly.
      Previously the escaping was only done for character data, now it's done
      for all data types (unless -useCDATA is specified).
Fix:  (100.7) "Check table dependencies" did not always work correctly for 
      deleting tables, when one of the selected tables was also a child
      of one of the tables that were added during FK checking and that table
      was a self-referencing table.
Fix:  (100.7) WbSchemaDiff did not release the connections properly.
Fix:  (100.7) The row height was not retained when editing values in the 
      result set or applying a filter
Fix:  (100.6) Calling stored procedures with output parameters was not working 
      properly, especially when regular parameters were needed as well.
Fix:  (100.6) Tried to make retrieval in the DbExplorer more robust agains
      hanging connections.
Fix:  (100.5) In some cases WbInclude would fail processing a script.
Fix:  (100.5) When using -append=true and -createTable=true for SQL Exports 
      the CREATE TABLE was not written (appended) to the output file (because 
      WbExport would never write the "header" for an export that appends to
      an existing file, which does not make sense for SQL INSERT exports.
Fix:  (100.4) When importing a directory using -sourceDir, WbImport would 
      treat the files containing tables lobs as regular table files e.g. 
      searching for a table mytable_lobs.
Fix:  (100.4) Resolving table dependencies for INSERT (WbImport) or DELETE
      did not work if the list of tables contained a self-referencing table
      that was referenced by another (parent) table.
Fix:  (100.4) A change to the driver for a connection profile was not detected
      as a change, so the user was not asked to save the profiles when stopping
      the application
Fix:  (100.3) The toolbar was not always correctly repainted when a workspace
      was closed
Fix:  (100.3) When "Autosave Workspace" was enabled and the workspace contained
      an external file, the user was prompted if the file should be saved
      each time a statement was executed. Now the external file is automatically
      saved as well, when the workspace is saved.
Fix:  (100.3) When a script ended with a statement that had a dangling
      single quote, the last (incorrect) statement was not executed at all
Fix:  (100.3) Common Table Expressions (WITH ... AS ...) were not formatted
      correctly.
Fix:  (100.3) "Copy data to clipboard" was not always enabled, even if a 
      result set was available.
Fix:  (100.2) When using "Search table data" in the DbExplorer, the connection
      profile attribute "Trim CHAR data" were not used to retrieve the data.
Fix:  (100.2) The SQL source for sequences was no longer displayed.
Fix:  (100.2) The application did not always ask to save the connection
      profiles even if they were modified
Fix:  (100.2) Triggers were not displayed for DB2 when the server was running
      on 64bit Windows
Fix:  (100.2) When changing the the current database in the DbExplorer 
      in MySQL, updating the data did not work, because the table
      in the update statement was not fully qualified (to include the 
      database name)
Fix:  (100.1) The Option "Map Oracle DATE to Timestamp" was only applied
      when restarting the application
Fix:  (100.1) WbExport's XML format now defaults to XML 1.0 again. An option 
      has been added for WbExport to select version 1.1 if that is needed
      in order to use the newly allowed characters. XML 1.1 support
      can be enabled using -xmlVersion=1.1 
      The default can be set with the property workbench.xml.default.version
Fix:  (100.1) Using WbInclude with a multi-byte characterset (e.g. UTF8) 
      did not work properly 
Fix:  (100.1) The WHEN condition for Oracle triggers was not displayed in the 
      SQL source. Thanks to Marcel for the fix.
Fix:  (100.1) WbInclude did not give a proper error message if the specified
      file was not found.

Build 100, 17.05.2008

      are of the tab title display (as with Firefox)
Enh:  (99.9) The display of the tab index can now be disabled in the 
      general options.
Enh:  (99.8) A new property to treat Oracle DATE columns as timestamp

      will overwrite the setting for Oracle's JDBC driver.
Enh:  (99.8) The XML export now writes XML 1.1 to allow for escaped control 
      characters that are below 0x20
Enh:  (99.8) WbCopy can now optionally delete rows from the target table that 
      are not present in the source table. To enable this, use the parameter 
      -syncDelete=true
Enh:  (99.7) The output of WbSchemaReport now contains a new tag 
      <foreign-keys> that contains the definition for each foreign key to

      switching to a tab and a new connection is created.
Enh:  (99.6) WbImport can now import multiple files from a source directory 
      into a single table. When both -sourceDir and -table are specified all 
      files from the source directory are imported into the target table. 
      Note that -deleteTarget does not work in this mode.
Enh:  (99.6) The "Drop Tables" dialog in the DbExplorer can now sort the
      tables according to their FK references in order to allow dropping 
      them with DBMS that do not support a cascading DROP
Enh:  (99.6) The "Drop Tables" and "Drop Columns" dialogs in the DbExplorer 
      can now also display the generated script.

Fix:  (99.10) The formatter did not process CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT 
Fix:  (99.10) When moving tabs while "Use separate connection per tab", the
      moved tab was not always connected properly.
Fix:  (99.10) Descending indexes were not displayed correctly for Oracle

      workspace was not automatically saved and the connections were not 
      managed correctly if "Separate Connection per Tab" was used.
Fix:  (99.10) Using $wb_skip$ with the -fileColumns parameter did not work 
      when importing multiple files into a single table
Fix:  (99.10) The parameter -fileColumns did not working when importing
      multiple files into a single table
Fix:  (99.9) The parameter -keyColumns was broken for WbCopy

      a DBMS that does not support sequences the command silently failed
      without an error message.
Fix:  (99.8) The SQL source for table and column comments was not generated
      correctly
Fix:  (99.7) The syntax highlighting for multi-line comments using /* .. */
      was incorrect
Fix:  (99.7) The data types of the target columns were not retrieved correctly
      for WbCopy if a column mapping was defined.
Fix:  (99.7) -createTarget=true was broken for WbImport with XML files

      were not displayed if the procedure/package name was no specified 
      in upper-case in the CREATE statement.
Fix:  (99.6) In Oracle, the datatype was not displayed correctly for columns 
      with the datatype NUMBER (no further details) in the DbExplorer
Fix:  (99.5) When hitting ENTER at the end of a line with no with no whitespace
      the line was duplicated
Fix:  (99.4) Scripts with line comments that contained a single quote were
      not processed correctly if the line comment did not start at the first
      column of the line.

Build 99, 01.03.2008
--------------------
Enh:  (98.6) Files generated by WbExport are now always lowercase
Enh:  (98.6) When running in batch mode, individual update counts can now 
      be consolidated into a single message at the end (similar to the 
      "Consolidate script log" in the GUI) using the new parameter
      -consolidateMessages=true
Enh:  (98.5) When exporting data with WbExport to a spreadsheet format 
      (OpenDocument, Excel) parameter -header now defaults to true
Enh:  (98.2) WbExport can now create OpenDocument Spreadsheet files (ods)
      and Excel XML spreadsheets (xslx)
Enh:  (98.2) Thanks to Alessandro an export to a native Excel file is now
      also available. In order to use the Excel export, it is necessary
      to copy the POI library (http://poi.apache.org) into the same directory
      where workbench.jar is located. The POI library has to have the 
      name poi.jar
Enh:  (98.1) The launcher executable has been renamed to SQLWorkbench.exe
      and the shell script has been renamed to sqlworkbench.sh
Enh:  (98.1) WbExport can now optionally create the necessary output directory 
      when using the new option -createDir=true 
Enh:  (98.1) When running in batch mode the current connection can be changed
      using the new command WbConnect. It accepts the same parameters to
      define a connection as the commandline. The command will be ignored
      when running the GUI.
Fix:  (98.5) The DbExplorer panel now remembers the focused component when 
      switching tabs.
Fix:  (98.5) When using "Save Data as" with a spreadsheet exports, writing
      the header row could not be turned on.
Fix:  (98.4) Running SELECTs did not work for certain data types with the 
      SQLite JDBC driver

      if the matching bracket was not visible in the editor.
Fix:  (98.1) When disabling "Open DbExplorer as tab", the DbExplorer window
      would fail to display the db information when shown for the second time
Fix:  (98.1) The reload button did not work in the DbExplorer data panel, 
      if "Autoload table row count" was disabled.

Fix:  (98.1) The parameter -logfile was no longer working if the specified
      logfile did not already exist.


Build 98, 13.01.2008
--------------------
Enh:  (97.10) The Mac Bundle now comes with a universal binary (launcher) 
      so it should run on PowerPC and Intel Macs. Thanks to Matt for
      providing me with the new binary
Enh:  (97.10) Editor tabs can now be re-order using Drag & Drop.
Enh:  (97.9) In batch mode warnings reported when connecting to the DBMS
      are now retrieved (and logged) immediately.
Enh:  (97.9) Columns can now be dropped from within the DbExplorer's 
      table definition.
Enh:  (97.8) The text in the "What's new" window content can now be searched
Enh:  (97.8) The data display in the DbExplorer now remembers the 
      sort column when the data for a table is reloaded (but not 
      when a different table is selected). This can be controlled through
      the options dialog
Enh:  (97.7) The "Extended Properties" button in the connection dialog 
      will now display a little checkmark if properties are defined for
      the currently selected profile
Enh:  (97.7) Errors during retrieval of the data can now be ignored. The 
      application will use NULL for these columns instead. This can be 
      enabled by setting the property:
      workbench.db.ignore.readerror=true 
      in workbench.settings.
Enh:  (97.7) Columns can now be searched for from the table header popup
      If the column is found, the display is scrolled to display 
      that column. The search is done on partial matches. The first 
      column where the entered value is found somewhere in the column 
      name is displayed.
Enh:  (97.7) When searching in table data, all found values can now be 
      highlighted. 
Enh:  (97.7) When saving a result set to a text file, the decimal character
      could not be defined (the default from the options panel was used)
Enh:  (97.6) The current line in the editor can how be highlighted
Enh:  (97.6) A background color to indicate null values in the 
      result set can now be defined
Enh:  (97.6) a new parameter for WbCopy and WbImport has been added:
      -transactionControl. It defaults to true. If set to false
      no commit or rollback will be sent to the DBMS after the import
      has finished. If savepoints are enabled they are still used
      during the import (or copy) process
Enh:  (97.6) More detailed information about the DBMS and the driver
      is now available from the context menu of the connection information
      in the toolbar.
Enh:  (97.4) When exporting a table with BLOB columns the filename to 
      be used for the BLOB files can now be defined through a column
      of the result set using -filenameColumn=col_name.
      This will only make sense when exporting a table with exactly 
      one BLOB column.
Enh:  (97.4) WbImport and WbCopy now support the -preTableStatement and 
      the -postTableStatement to define (a single) SQL statement to 
      be execute before an import into a table starts and after inserting
      into that table is finished. 
Enh:  (97.3) WbImport (an WbCopy) will now ignore the -deleteTarget or
      -truncateTarget option if the selected mode is not INSERT (to 
      prevent accidental deletion of records if e.g. update mode 
      is selected)
Enh:  (97.3) If no config directory is supplied and no settings file
      is found in either the current directory or the directory where
      the jar file is located, the settings are now written to the 
      user's home directory (in the sub-directory .sqlworkbench). 
      For a new installation this means that the configuration settings
      are no longer stored in the program's directory.
Enh:  (97.3) The HTML version of the manual is now displayed using 
      an external browser rather than using the built-in HTML display. 
Enh:  (97.2) Highlighting the control that has the focus in the DbExplorer
      can now be enabled by setting the property:
      workbench.gui.dbobjects.showfocus=true
      This is disabled by default.
      The default color for the focus border is yellow, the color can be 
      configured using the property:
      workbench.gui.focusindicator.bordercolor
      with the RGB value (e.g. 128,128,128) for the desired color.
Enh:  (97.1) For Oracle, REF CURSORS as out parameters in Procedures are now
      supported through WbCall, e.g: WbCall ref_cursor_example(42, ?);
Enh:  (97.1) You can now assign a shortcut to the reload buttons in the 
      DbExplorer. The shortcut will only work if the component does have
      the focus.
Fix:  (97.10) Null values for numeric columns could not be imported into an
      Access database.
Fix:  (97.10) After moving editor-tabs the menus were no longer working correctly.
Fix:  (97.10) Table definitions could not always retrieved when using Oracle 
      (e.g. in the DbExplorer)
Fix:  (97.9) Indexes with complex expressions (e.g. CASE ...) where not
      displayed correctly in the generated SQL for a table
Fix:  (97.9) The label in the DbExplorer panels "REFERENCES" and 
      "REFERENCED BY" were the wrong way round.
Fix:  (97.8) Character literals spanning multiple lines were not colored
      correctly (especially if the start was not visible)
Fix:  (97.8) Using WbVardef without a value did not delete the variable.
Fix:  (97.8) When using WbCopy with a column mapping and the -createTarget
      parameter the target table could not be created due to an error
      in the generated SQL.
Fix:  (97.7) When opening several new panels very quickly the application 
      could lock.
Fix:  (97.7) The application could not be started in batch mode without
      supplying a connection (either through the commandline or using
      a profile).
Fix:  (97.6) When importing integer numbers using WbImport numbers with 
      scientific notation could not be imported even if they were "real"
      integer values (e.g. 4.2E+1).
Fix:  (97.5) Referencing the input file for WbImport using relative files
      paths was broken.
Fix:  (97.5) When opening and closing multiple windows (File -> Open New Window)
      and using separate connections per tab, sometimes the wrong connections 
      were closed.
Fix:  (97.4) The path for a Look & Feel library was not saved, when it 
      was edited manually (instead of using the file-open dialog)
Fix:  (97.4) The new parameter -checkDependencies was not working correctly
      for large schemas with deeply nested foreign keys.
Fix:  (97.4) Sequence definitions were not retrieved correctly for HSQLDB
Fix:  (97.2) The "What's New" dialog was no longer displayed.
Fix:  (97.2) The update check did not always find a new version
Fix:  (97.1) When using an old JDBC driver that did not implement savepoints
      WbImport was not working even if the usage of savepoints was turned off
Fix:  (97.1) Scripts for MySQL using non-standard line comments (with #) were 
      not executed correctly.
Fix:  (97.1) The toolbar button for "Append results" did not reflect the current
      setting of this option. Only the menu item in the SQL menu did.

Build 97, 21.10.2007
--------------------
Enh:  (96.9) A new option has been added to define additional characters
      that are recognized as word characters e.g. when jumping word by word
      (using ctrl-left, ctrl-right) or selecting words in the editor using
      a doubleclick (Available under Tools -> Options -> Editor options)
Enh:  (96.9) Added an option to reformat the view sourced when it's retrieved
      from the database. This is not enabled by default. To turn it on
      set the property:
			workbench.db.[dbid].source.view.doformat=true
      in workbench.settings.
Enh:  (96.8) The global option "Enable dbms_output" has been removed. If you 
      want to enable support for the DBMS_OUTPUT package, please use a
      pre-connect script in the connection profile.
Enh:  (96.7) When creating a new physical connection for a tab using the new
      "Connect tab" feature, this connection can now be reset to the global
      connection. The tab's title is also displayed in a different color.
      The extra connection can now also be controlled through the popup 
      menu for a tab
Enh:  (96.7) When deleting rows from a result, the rows can now be deleted
      including all dependent rows using "Delete With Dependencies"
Enh:  (96.6) The extended connection properties can now optionally be copied
      into the system properties when the connection is created. This can 
      be used for JDBC drivers that only support System properties 
      (such as H2)
Enh:  (96.6) When not using "Separate Connection per tab", a new physical 
      connection for the current tab can now be created using 
      "File -> New Connection"
Enh:  (96.6) The definition for JDBC drivers are now stored without a path
      separator in WbDrivers.xml in order to make the configuration file
      work on different platforms. To save the driver definitions in the new
      format, the "Manage Driver" dialog needs to be opened and closed once.
Enh:  (96.6) The definition for Look And Feels (Tools -> Options) is now
      stored with a platform independent path separator in workbench.settings 
      to make it easier to share the .settings file between platforms.
Enh:  (96.6) When using "Check foreign keys" in the "Delete data" dialog, any
      dependent table that was not selected, can now optionally be added
      to the list.
Enh:  (96.5) WbCopy can now be used with multiple tables, e.g. 
      -sourceTable=* to copy all tables, or -sourceTable=table1,table2.
      Specific column or table mappings are not possible in that mode. 
      All tables with from the the source are copied to all tables
      with the same name in the target DB. If copying multiple tables, it the
      responsibility of the user to specify them in the correct order (so 
      that no foreign key constraint is violated)
Enh:  (96.5) WbImport and WbCopy now support the -checkDependencies
      parameter. If set to true, SQL Workbench/J will analyze the 
      foreign key dependencies of the tables and will import/copy them
      such that the parent tables are processed before and referencing
      child tables. The parameter is only checked if a multi-table mode
      is used in both commands ("WbCopy -sourceTable=*" or 
      "WbImport -sourceDir=somedir".
Enh:  (96.5) When using "Delete data" from within the DbExplorer, the 
      list of tables can now be sorted according to their FK constraints.
Enh:  (96.5) Empty column and table comments can now be included in the 
      generated SQL source for a table. This can be configured in 
      Tools -> Options -> SQL Generation
Enh:  (96.5) The toolbar can now be hidden (View -> Toolbar). 
      Thanks to Petr for the patch.
Enh:  (96.4) Importing data into Oracle NCLOB columns is now possible. 
Enh:  (96.3) WbSchemaReport and WbSchemaDif can now also include sequences. To 
      include sequences, use the new parameter -includeSequences=true (the 
      default is false)
Enh:  (96.3) WbCopy (DataPumper) and WbExport into a XML file did not work with 
      Oracle when a NVARCHAR2 column was involved. This was due to the fact that 
      the Oracle driver does not report the correct datatype for. A workaround 
      has been added so that NVARCHAR2 (and NCHAR) columns are treated as 
      java.sql.Types.VARCHAR instead of java.sql.Types.OTHER.
      This workaround is enabled by default and can be disabled by setting
      workbench.db.oracle.fixnvarchartype=false
      in workbench.settings
Enh:  (96.3) Support for stored procedures with OUT parameters has been added 
      for drivers that support the necessary calls. It has been tested with 
      Oracle (11g driver), MySQL (5.0), SQL Server 2005 (Microsoft Driver) and 
      IBM DB9 9 (Linux). 
      The procedure needs to be called with the new keyword WbCall: 
      WbCall myproc(?) 
      All out parameters of the procedure will be displayed. 
      Wehn setting the property:
      workbench.db.[dbid].procs.use.wbcall=true
      SQL Workbench/J will also apply the new logic when executing the CALL 
      statement. As this might potentially lead to compatibility problems it is 
      disabled by default.
Enh:  (96.3) A background color for the connection info display can now be 
      defined on a per profile basis (to e.g. identify "critical" connections)
Enh:  (96.1) Added support for SQLite
Enh:  (96.1) Code completion now recognizes an alias of the outer statement 
      inside a sub-select.
Enh:  (96.1) WbImport can now also import files with fixed columns 
      (no delimiter) using the -columnWidths parameter
Enh:  (96.1) The code-completion dropdown now allows multi-selection
Enh:  (96.1) WbExport can now also write a format file for SQL Server's 
      bcp utility. The file is created by using the new switch 
      -formatFile=sqlserver  
      The switch can also be used to write an SQL*Loader file using 
      '-formatFile=oracle'. Creating both files is possible using 
      '-formatFile=oracle,sqlserver'
      The old parameter '-writeOracleLoader=true' is still supported
Enh:  (96.1) For DDL Statements a Savepoint can now be enabled so that 
      DBMS which cannot continue the current transaction after a DDL error
      do not require a manual rollback (e.g. Postgres). This makes the 
      option "Ignore DROP Errors" work for Postgres when not running in 
      autocommit mode.
      This is controlled with the property
      workbench.db.[dbid].ddl.usesavepoint=true
      Running imports using the update/insert (or insert/update) mode
      will not work with Postgres as well. SQL Workbench/J can now use a 
      savepoint to guard the first of the two statements so that the transaction 
      can continue. This is controlled using 
      workbench.db.[dbid].import.usesavepoint=true
Fix:  (96.9) The JDBC/ODBC bridge could no longer be loaded
Fix:  (96.9) Tab names with non-ISO characters were not stored correctly in 
      the workspace.
Fix:  (96.8) WbSchemaDiff could not be run in batch mode.
Fix:  (96.8) When changing a value in the result set from null to something else
      the column was not included in the generated update statements.
Fix:  (96.7) It was not possible to edit a value in the result set that was null 
      (e.g. setting a non-null value)
Fix:  (96.7) When not specifying a database with the connection URL for MySQL and 
      not using separate connections per tab, displaying data in the DbExplorer
      did not work (nor did the display of Enums)
Fix:  (96.7) Displaying the table's rowcount in the DbExplorer did not work with 
      old MS SQL drivers when autocommit was turned off
Fix:  (96.5) Single quotes in comments were not escaped correctly in generated
      table source
Fix:  (96.4) When using workbench.db.oracle.fixcharsemantics=true, NVARCHAR2 
      columns were also displayed with Byte/Char semantics.
Fix:  (96.4) Retrieving sequences was broken for DB2
Fix:  (96.3) Oracle packages were not correctly written into the output file of 
      WbSchemaReport or WbSchemaDiff
Fix:  (96.3) The display of the source of stored procedures was broken for 
      SQL Server
Fix:  (96.3) When reloading the list of indexes in the DbExplorer, all subsequent
      retrieval operations were blocked.
Fix:  (96.3) Removed the automatic detection of available translations (because
      it slowed down startup too much). If a new  translation is added, this now 
      needs to be defined in workbench.properties
Fix:  (96.2) The column label for the key column selection in the DataPumper was
      not readable with certain look & feels
Fix:  (96.2) When running WbImport -header=false on an empty file, SQL Workbench/J
      reported an error because it could not read the header line.
Fix:  (96.1) WbCopy when used with -createTable did no re-create NOT NULL
      constraints on the columns.
Fix:  (96.1) Added some missing german localizations. The Version number
      was not displayed correctly as well, when German was selected as the 
      UI language.
Fix:  (96.1) Search did not work in the editor if no text was selected.
Fix:  (96.1) The parameter -trimValues for WbImport was not documented
Fix:  (96.1) Fixed some problems when printing tables that spread horizontally
      over more than one page.
Fix:  (96.1) Fixed a race condition upon startup when the automatic update 
      check was enabled.
Fix:  (96.1) Fixed a race condition when closing the application which sometimes
      caused the application process to remain in memory.
Fix:  (96.1) The {$clobfile} syntax could not be used with Apache Derby and 
      source files with a multi-byte encoding (such as UTF-8)
      
Build 96, 05.08.2007
--------------------
Enh:  (95.5) A German localization for the GUI is now available. The GUI 
      language can be switched from within the Options Panel (General Options).
Enh:  (95.5) A new option "Trim CHAR data" has been added to the connection.
      profile. If this is enabled, values retrieved from columns with 
      the CHAR datatype are trimmed (as the CHAR data is padded on 
      most DBMS)
Enh:  (95.4) A "keep alive" statement can now be defined in the 
      "Connect Scripts" dialog, that will send a statement at defined
      intervals to the server to prevent the connection from beeing
      closed.
Enh:  (95.2) A new option to sort pasted columns (for auto-completion)
       according to their position in the database has been added 
      (Tools -> Options -> Editor)
Enh:  (95.1) When importing files using mode=insert static values can now 
      be specified for specific columns that are not part of the input file
      (using the switch -constantValues)
Enh:  (95.1) The filenames generated for blob files are not converted
      to lowercase anymore. This means when using -lobIdCols to create the
      blob filenames from the column data, the original case will be preserved.
Fix:  (95.5) Improved the error handling when displaying table data in the
      DbExplorer
Fix:  (95.5) No tables where shown when invoking code completion for an 
      INSERT INTO statement was broken.
Fix:  (95.5) "Create DDL Script" in the DbExplorer was not working for 
      sequences.
Fix:  (95.4) The selected case for table name when generating statements (from
      withing the options dialog) is now ignored if the driver reports that 
      the server is case sensitive for object names.
Fix:  (95.4) SQL Workbench/J would send a SHUTDOWN command to a Derby server
      when disconnection. This no only done for the embedded driver.
Fix:  (95.4) Copying data as INSERT or UPDATE to the clipboard from 
      a SELECT that contained more than row failed (and did not ask
      for the update table)
Fix:  (95.4) -lineFilter did exclude the specified columns instead of 
      including only the matching rows.
Fix:  (95.4) Mixing function calls and constants with the -constantValues
      switch for WbImport did not work
Fix:  (95.4) It was not possible to specify a blank as the delimiter when 
      importing text files. This can now be done using -delimiter="' '"
Fix:  (95.4) WbImport would fail with a NullPointerException if a column was
      listed twice in the -fileColumns argument.
Fix:  (95.4) When importing text files with -quoteCharEscaping enabled,
      WbImport would fail if a column had a null value
Fix:  (95.3) WbExport with a SELECT as the source was broken
Fix:  (95.3) The source for tables that contained $ characters (or other 
      characters that are used for regular expressions) could not be displayed.
Fix:  (95.2) WbVardef trimmed spaces inside quoted values.
Fix:  (95.2) When reformatting SELECT statements with a CASE that defines a 
      column alias (CASE .. END AS someCol) no whitespace was put before 
      the AS during reformatting.
Fix:  (95.1) It was no longer possible to run SQL Workbench in batch mode
      without a profile (for e.g. a single WbCopy command where the 
      profiles are specified as part of the WbCopy parameters)

Build 95, 09.06.2007
--------------------
Enh:  (94.8) A special date and timestampformat "millis" can now be specified
      for WbImport (e.g. -timestampFormat=millis). This will treat the value
      as a numeric value representing the milliseconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00
      (and thus can be used to create a java.util.Date() object directly)
Enh:  (94.8) When using -lobIdCols with WbExport the name of the export
      file is no longer part of the generated LOB filename if -compress=true
      is used.
Enh:  (94.6) Ctrl-Shift-C (Comment Selection) now acts as a toggle. If this
      is invoked on a text that is not commented, the line comment character
      will be added. If the complete selection is already commented, then 
      the comments will be removed. 
      Ctrl-Shift-U (Uncomment Selection) works as before
Enh:  (94.6) You can now select the elements that should be shown in the 
      main window's title bar. The name of profile group and the current
      workspace can be enabled/disabled. The display of the current editor's
      filename has been moved from the "Editor" page in the options dialog
      to the new "Window Title" page.
Enh:  (94.6) WbImport tries to figure the import type according to the file 
      extension of the import file. Text import is assumed for the extensions
      txt or csv whereas XML import is assumed for the extension xml
      When importing compressed exports, the type parameter is still 
      necesary.
Enh:  (94.5) The handling of date/datetime keywords when entering data 
      has been modified. You can now specify keywords for the three different
      JDBC datatypes (date, timestamp, time) and the value that is created
      depends on the type of the keyword (keywords for date will not 
      include the time portion, keywords for time will not incude a 
      date part). The detection is independent of the type of the column
      (i.e. you can enter current_timestamp in a date column to get the 
      time part as well for e.g. Oracle DATE columns). The differen keywords
      can be defined in workbench.settings. The default entries are: 
      workbench.db.keyword.current_date=current_date,today
      workbench.db.keyword.current_time=current_time,now
      workbench.db.keyword.current_timestamp=current_timestamp,sysdate,systimestamp
      So when you enter current_date in a date (or timestamp) column the 
      current date without the time (i.e. the time will be 00:00) part will be 
      sent to the DBMS. When you enter e.g. sysdate in a date column the value 
      sent to the DBMS will include the time part.
Enh:  (94.5) The literals that are accepted as true/false for converting
      boolean values can now be defined using two new parameters for the 
      WbImport command: -literalsFalse -literalsTrue this also affects
      the parsing of values for the -booleanToNumber=true mode. The default
      literals for the number conversion has been limited to true/false. 
      Literals that are not "known" (either through the default or by 
      specifying them using the -literalsXXX switch) are now always rejected
      (before they were silently converted to false)
Enh:  (94.4) The automatic conversion of the values true/false to numeric
      values 1/0 can now be disabled for WbImport using the parameter
      -booleanToNumber=false (the default is true)
Enh:  (94.4) The default shortcut for auto-completion has been changed 
      to Ctrl-Space
Enh:  (94.4) WbImport and WbExport can now control how quote characters 
      that are contained in the data are treated. The new argument
      -quoteCharEscaping defines the expected input format or the format
      to be written. Possible values are none,duplicate or escape. 
Enh:  (94.3) Using mode=insert,update is no possible with PostgreSQL. Due
      to PG's error handling this required a savepoint around the INSERT
      statement that could be rolled back. Doing the INSERT in a 
      sub-transaction with savepoints can be enabled for other DBMS using
      workbench.db.[dbid].import.usesavepoint=true
Enh:  (94.2) The application can now automatically check for updates 
Enh:  (94.2) The log level can now be changed from within the options dialog
      (no need to restart SQL Workbench)
Enh:  (94.2) When entering values in date (timestamp) columns the keywords
      now, sysdate, current_date and current_timestamp are replaced with 
      the current date/time. Note that this will be the local timezone 
      of the machine where SQL Workbench is running, not the time of the
      DBMS Server
Enh:  (94.2) Under MacOS the Apple+Q shortcut is now working to exit the 
      application (as well as the about and preferences keys)
Enh:  (94.2) Re-designed the options dialog
Enh:  (94.2) When using "Put SELECT into" from within the DbExplorer the 
      statement can now be appended to the selected editor by holding
      down the CTRL-Key while selecting the menu item.
Enh:  If no encoding is supplied WbExport now uses UTF-8 as the encoding for 
      XML exports and the system default encoding for text exports. It also
      reports the default encoding in the help when no parameter is supplied. 
      The default encoding for text exports can be changed using the property
      workbench.file.data.encoding
Fix:  (94.8) When entering values in the result set that could not be 
      converted to the correct data type, no error message was shown.
Fix:  (94.7) Auto-completion for tables from other schemas was broken
Fix:  (94.7) The update count for DELETE and UPDATE statements was not 
      shown properly.
Fix:  (94.7) -decode now correctly decodes a \\ to a (single) \ 
Fix:  (94.7) "Ignore Drop Errors" was not working any longer (that included
      the commandline switch for running in batch mode)
Fix:  (94.7) The automatic update check did not always work.
Fix:  (94.7) The -sourceTable switch from WbExport did not preserve quotes
      so that exports with case-sensitive table names could only be done
      using a SELECT after the WbExport.
Fix:  (94.6) Not all error messages (e.g. missing parameters for WbExport) 
      were reported in the log file during batch execution.
Fix:  (94.6) When opening a file in a SQL tab that contained a modified
      file, No and Cancel would both do the same when beeing asked to 
      save or discard the changes.
Fix:  (94.6) Numeric values that were returned as BigDecimal by the 
      JDBC Driver were not displayed according to the chosen max. number of 
      digits (in the options dialog)
Fix:  (94.6) The integration with Mac OS is now working properly.
Fix:  (94.6) Fixed the processing of "batches" sent to SQL Server. If a 
      multi-statement SQL is sent to SQL Server that also returned result
      sets, the result was not always shown.
Fix:  (94.6) WbImport with -decode=true was not always working properly
Fix:  (94.5) No error messages was shown on the console if the specified
      driver class could not be loaded when running SQL Workbench/J in 
      batch mode.
Fix:  (94.5) Improved the performance when importing compressed input files
      with a large number of associated LOB files (in an extra archive).
Fix:  (94.5) When importing a text file without a header definition and the 
      target table did not exist no proper error message was shown.
Fix:  (94.5) When using -truncateTable=true or -deleteTarget=true for WbImport 
      an error during truncate/delete would not be reported.
Fix:  (94.5) Some keystrokes (e.g. Alt-F4) started editing mode in the 
      result table that should not start editing.
Fix:  (94.4) When only importing part of an import file (using -startRow
      and -endRow) the import would fail if data in the ignored rows
      failed validation.
Fix:  (94.4) Conversion errors where not reported correctly when importing 
      XML files with WbImport
Fix:  (94.4) SQL Workbench does not try to set a default font for GUI elements
      any more. A previously selected standard font can be reset through 
      the options panel.
Fix:  (94.3) DbExplorer now shows the source for indexes on views 
      (e.g. MATERIALIZED VIEWS) as well. The index definitions are also
      included by WbReport and WbSchemaDiff
Fix:  (94.4) If the text in the editor ended with a @ command executing 
      the SQL command at the cursor position did not work
Fix:  (94.3) The type of an index was not displayed correctly with MySQL
Fix:  (94.3) Not all comparators were selectable in the filter dialog
Fix:  (94.3) When using the "Drop.." dialog from the DbExplorer SQL Workbench/J 
      was offering the CASCADE option for MySQL even though it is not supported
      by MySQL.
Fix:  (94.3) The tooltip for columns with NULL value displayed the value 
      of the previous column
Fix:  (94.3) The history for the quickfilter in the DbExplorer's Object list
      was not saved when the DbExplorer was opened as a separate window.
Fix:  (94.2) When switching tabs while the completion popup was open and then 
      returning to the original tab, keystrokes would not be inserted into the
      editor.
Fix:  (94.2) Workaround for a bug in older Postgres drivers where 
      getMoreResults() would throw a NPE if the statement did not 
      produce a result set.
Fix:  (94.2) WbImport with XML files did not work with columns that contained 
      special characters
Fix:  (94.2) SQL Workbench would not load with the Substance look and feel.
Fix:  (94.2) The search dialog did not automatically use the currently 
      selected text.
Fix:  (94.2) The property workbench.db.oracle.syntax.functions was growing
      with each start of the application.
Fix:  (94.1) The quick filter for the new trigger list was not working

Build 94, 31.03.2007
--------------------
Enh:  (93.9) When doing single-table imports with WbImport VARCHAR or CHAR 
      columns that exceed a certain limit in the input file can now be 
      truncated using the -maxLength parameter. The format is
      -maxLength='column1=size1,column2=size2'
Enh:  (93.9) The DbExplorer now has an additional tab that lists all triggers
      of the selected catalog/schema. The new panel can be disabled in 
      the Options dialog (DbExplorer tab)
Enh:  (93.7) WbImport can now write a file with records that could not 
      be imported if run with continueOnError=true. The file is specified with
      -badFile=filename. If the filenanme indicates a directory, the actual
      file will be constructed by using the directory and the target table's
      name (needed for multi-table exports).
Enh:  (93.5) If a result set does not include all pk columns from the update 
      table, a warning is show when trying to save changes for the result.
Enh:  (93.5) Individual result tabs (when using "Append new results") can 
      now be closed (Data- > Close result)
Enh:  (93.5) The tooltip for the connection info now displays the driver
      version as well.
Enh:  (93.4) Data can now be changed in the result set by using 
      search & replace (Data -> Replace In Data)
Enh:  (93.3) The DbExplorer now displays the source for the underlying 
      table as well, when displaying the source for a synonym
Enh:  (93.3) WbExport now can optionally create ANSI or JDBC style date
      and timestamp literals when exporting to SQL statements. This is
      selected with the new switch -sqlDateLiterals
      The default literal type for copying SQL statements to the clipboard
      can be defined in the options dialog.
      Additional literal types can be defined through workbench.settings
      by supplying the approriate SimpleDateFormat patterns
Enh:  (93.2) When finding primary key columns to update the result set
      synonyms are now resolved as well.
Enh:  (93.1) A new command to prompt for a confirmation has been added. 
      WbConfirm will display the provided message and will allow to stop
      the current execution or continue. This will only be evaluated 
      in GUI mode (e.g. to prevent the accidental execution of "dangerous"
      scripts)
Fix:  (93.9) When statements were executed in nested WbIncludes not all
      error messages were reported to the console or the GUI (they did
      show up in the log file only).
Fix:  (93.9) The filemode for the Java launcher in the Mac package was not 
      set correctly so that the application could not be executed without 
      changes. To support the correct file attributes the Mac Bundle is 
      now distributed as a tgz (tar/gzip) archive which presevers the
      file attributes.
Fix:  (93.8) Using a SYNONYM as the source for WbCopy did not work.
Fix:  (93.8) column constraints like (COL_1 IS NOT NULL OR COL_2 IS NOT NULL)
      were not displayed in the DbExplorer for Oracle
Fix:  (93.8) For synonyms pointing to views the wrong source was created
Fix:  (93.8) If WbImport was used with -decode=true and a line contained
      an invalid escape sequence (e.g. a single backslash) the import
      would terminate with the wrong error message.
Fix:  (93.8) If a SELECT statement only contained an ORDER BY clause 
      but no WHERE clause, auto completion did not show the columns 
      for the table
Fix:  (93.7) When using search & replace in the result, the wrong column 
      was highlighted after the first item was replaced.
Fix:  (93.6) The "internal" handling for the line ending was changed (back) 
      to always use the Unix format. SQL Statements can still be sent to the
      DBMS with DOS line endings, but the statements will now be converted
      before they are sent (rather than storing them with DOS line ending
      right away), which might have a performance impact when running large
      scripts.
Fix:  (93.6) Sometimes the application would ask to save changed profiles
      even if the profiles weren't changed.
Fix:  (93.6) Made quoting of schema names with digits work without changing
      the settings (objects with a digit at the first place are now 
      automatically quotes)
Fix:  (93.5) Quoting only the schema name for WbImport did not work (e.g.
      -table='"123".table'
Fix:  (93.5) If the semicolon for the last statement in the editor was
      placed on a single line, and the cursor was located left of the 
      semicolon in the same line, Ctrl-Enter would not work.
Fix:  (93.5) For Oracle, columns with 'TIMESTAMP WITH [LOCAL] TIMEZONE' 
      data type are not retrieved using getTimestamp() instead of getObject()
      to be able to properly display the data for those columns. 
Fix:  (93.5) To be able to use columns with the data type 
      TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIMEZONE, the current timezone needs to be set
      for the session. The ALTER SESSION SET TIME_ZONE is now captured 
      and translated into the approriate Java call on the Oracle driver as 
      described in 
      http://download-uk.oracle.com/docs/cd/B19306_01/java.102/b14355/oraint.htm#sthref175
Fix:  (93.4) Quoted table names could not be passed to the WbImport command
      (e.g. -table='"MYTABLE"') which is necessary for case-sensitive servers
Fix:  (93.4) Warnings that are reported by the JDBC driver after switching
      the current database are now ignored and do not set the "warning"
      state for the executed command.
Fix:  (93.4) When running a script in batch mode that ended with a comment
      the process was terminated with an error status.
Fix:  (93.3) WbImport did not always close the input files correctly.
Fix:  (93.3) When exporting data to SQL scripts, timestamp columns were
      not formatted correctly
Fix:  (93.2) Code completion was not working for (Oracle) synonyms
Fix:  (93.1) The DbExplorer failed to retrieve the table definition and table 
      data for MS SQL Server if the server was defined with a case sensitive
      collation.
Fix:  (93.1) The table reference navigation was not always reset in the 
      DbExplorer data tab and displayed the referenced tables from a previous
      table

Build 93, 11.02.2007
--------------------
Enh:  (92.6) When displaying a BLOB content as text, the content can now 
      be modified. The character set conversion will be done using the 
      selected encoding from the info dialog (both directions)
Enh:  (92.4) WbReport and WbSchemaDiff can now optionally include the 
      table grants (new parameter -includeTableGrants)
Enh:  (92.4) The parameter -includeProcs for WbSchemaDiff has been renamed to 
      -includeProcedures to be consistent with WbReport
Enh:  (92.4) The deferrable attribute of a FK reference is now shown
      in the DbExplorer and the generated SQL source.
Enh:  (92.2) Workbench specific commands are now supported by the auto 
      completion
Enh:  (92.2) The filter in the table list of the DbExplorer now accepts
      regular expressions. Thanks to Petr for the patch
Enh:  (92.1) The (plain) editor used to edit column data from within 
      the result display now supports Search & Replace.
Enh:  (92.1) A new setting to close the application if the first connect
      is cancelled is available
      workbench.gui.cancel.firstconnect.exit
      If this is set to true, the application is closed if the connection 
      dialog that is displayed during startup is cancelled
Enh:  (92.1) For Synonyms, the DbExplorer now displays the foreign keys,
      indexes and triggers of the underlying table.
Fix:  (92.7) Copying BLOB columns was broken for WbCopy and DataPumper 
Fix:  (92.6) The option "Single line" for the default alternate delimiter
      (Tool -> Options -> Editor) was not saved.
Fix:  (92.6) The window position was not restored properly if the window
      was moved to the uper left corner.
Fix:  (92.5) When importing a text file that references blob files, 
      absolute filenames for the blob files did not work.
Fix:  (92.4) WbSchemaDiff did not include the necessary entries to drop 
      views from the target database if includeViews was set to true
Fix:  (92.4) The generated report for WbSchemaDiff did not contain tables
      that only differed in the index definition.
Fix:  (92.4) Code completion for the WHERE part of a DELETE statement was not 
      working.
Fix:  (92.4) A SQL panel could be moved between two DbExplorer panels but 
      when reloading this workspace the SQL panel would be dropped.
Fix:  (92.3) When running WbExport using -clobAsFile=true and
       -writeOracleLoader=true the generated SQL*Loader file did not contain
      the necessary syntax to load the CLOB data from the generated external
      files.
Fix:  (92.3) External tools where a parameter was needed for the executable
      (e.g. someapp.exe /h) could not be used from within the blob 
      display window.
Fix:  (92.3) Triggers and foreign keys were not correctly displayed
      for SQL Server with the jTDS driver.
Fix:  (92.3) When an invalid format for -timestampFormat or -dateFormat
      was specified for WbExport, no warning was displayed.
Fix:  (92.3) The manual listed incorrectly the parameter -dateTimeFormat instead
      of -timestampFormat
Fix:  (92.3) The -emptyStringIsNull switch for WbImport was broken.
Fix:  (92.3) The -append switch for WbExport was broken.
Fix:  (92.2) WbExport -sourcetable=something did not work if "something"
      was not a table (e.g. a Synonym)
Fix:  (92.2) When the current schema was changed in Oracle using ALTER SESSION
      the DbExplorer (when using the same connection) failed to retrieve
      table data for the old schema.
Fix:  (92.2) Reference navigation was broken outside the DbExplorer
Fix:  (92.1) Errors when committing changes in the DbExplorer were not shown 
      to the user.
Fix:  (92.1) The DataPumper did not use the selected encoding when importing
      a text or XML file.
Fix:  (92.1) Escaping of the delimiter has been changed for the WbExport 
      or the "Save Data as" commands. The following rules are now applied:
      if no character escaping is selected (-escapeText parameter) then 
      neither the quote character nor the delimiter are ever escaped. 
      If escaping is enabled, then the quote character will be escaped
      inside a quoted value and the delimiter will be escaped inside
      a non-quoted value regardless of the chosen escape range.

Build 92, 06.01.2007
--------------------
Enh:  (91.5) When searching for referencing/referenced tables, synonyms are 
      now detected.
Enh:  (91.5) Referenced/referencing rows can now be displayed into a new 
      SQL panel from within a SQL panel by holding down the Ctrl-Key when
      selecting the menu item of the popup menu.
Enh:  (91.4) From within a result display, related records based on 
      foreign key constrains can now be retrieved for the selected rows
Enh:  (91.4) When displaying (SQL)Exceptions the whole exception chain is now
      displayed (if available)
Enh:  (91.3) New results can now be added to the already displayed result
      (New Menu item SQL -> Append new results)
Enh:  (91.2) Large text fields are now displayed in multi-line mode (to be
      able to see all lines "Allow Row Height Resizing" must be enabled. For
      performace reasons this mode is only enabled for character columns that
      can hold more than 500 characters. This threshold can be configured using
      the property:
      workbench.gui.display.multilinethreshold
Enh:  (91.1) The alternate delimiter can now be defined for each profile. If 
      one is defined in the profile, this will overwrite the globally defined
      alternate delimiter. Additionally an alternate delimiter can now be 
      defined as "single line", which means that it has to occur as the only 
      text on a line in order to be recognized.
Enh:  (91.1) Delimiter and alternate Delimiter can now be specified in batch 
      mode as well. The parameter -altDelimiter will only have an effect if a 
      profile-less connection is used (basically defining the alternate 
      delimiter for the temporary profile)
      The argument -delimiter overrides the default delimiter and will turn
      off the usage of an alternate delimiter. This can be used if the scripts
      are not processed in memory but still use a non-standard delimiter
      (Similar to the -delimiter argument of the WbInclude command). To define
      a single line delimiter append the ;nl to the delimiter definition. E.g.
      -delimter=/;nl will define the forward slash as the delimiter but 
      only if it's the only character in a line. -delimiter=GO;nl will define
      a MS SQL Server compatible delimiter. 
      The additional automatic detection of the GO delimiter has been removed. 
      If you use GO as the delimiter, please change your profiles to use 
      that as the delimiter.
Fix:  (91.6) When saving changes from within the result set, errors during
      COMMIT were not reported to the user (e.g. with deferred constraints)
Fix:  (91.6) The source of a table was not displayed in the DbExplorer if 
      a comment contained characters that are valid regular expressions.
Fix:  (91.6) Some minor workarounds to make SQL Workbench/J work with tinySQL
Fix:  (91.5) When using a table alias with the AS keyword, code completion 
      did not work properly
Fix:  (91.4) The DbExplorer was not displayed when running on Debian Linux
      (Possibly with other Look & Feels as well)
Fix:  (91.4) The shortcuts for "Move tab left" and "Move tab right" could
      not be configured
Fix:  (91.4) Large integer numbers where not displayed correctly
Fix:  (91.3) "Create DDL Script" in the DbExplorer did not create the 
      DDL for materialized views in Oracle
Fix:  (91.3) Code completion was not working properly if the cursor was at 
      the end of the editor script
Fix:  (91.2) Fixed some problems with external files when switching line 
      endings
Enh:  (91.1) When running with feedback disabled (wbfeedback off) a message
      will now be printed if a statement finished with a warning
Fix:  (91.1) WbImport reported the wrong line number, when an error occurred
      during converting values from a text file.
Fix:  (91.1) Text values with embedded newlines were not displayed correctly
      in the edit window. 
Fix:  (91.1) When importing an XML file that contains a column that does
      exist in the target table, no error was reported (but the import
      failed nevertheless)
Fix:  (91.1) When running DML Statements (INSERT, DELETE, ...) with the
      Informix JDBC driver, it would throw an exception when retrieving
      the update count.
