--------------------
Fix:  When using a DBMS with schemas, the DbExplorer would not always
      retrieve the data correctly
Fix:  When running scripts with a large number of CREATE statements, a "Maximum
      number of open cursors exceeded" could occur with Oracle
Fix:  Workaround for JDBC drivers that do not support the setMaxRows() function
Fix:  When saving data from the result set, the export type was determined by
      the extension and not by the selected file filter. Thus an export into
      a text file with an extension other then txt did not work.
Fix:  The macro manager could not be closed if no macro was defined
Fix:  The Oracle data types NVARCHAR2 and NCHAR were not displayed
      correctly in the table definition
Fix:  The COPY command always required a -targetprofile
Fix:  The source for functions in PostgreSQL is not displayed correctly
Enh:  Added support for ThinkSQL

      primary keys inside the CREATE TABLE statement
Enh:  The status bar is now always displayed in the main window (not only when
      the result panel is visible)

Fix:  The MacroManager did not work if no macros where defined.
Fix:  The COPY command did not work if no columns where specified
Fix:  Adjusted the MetaData SQL for HSQLDB 1.7.2 Triggers

Fix:  The source code for VIEWS was wrong
Fix:  The last SQL tab could be closed.


Build 66, 10.01.2004

Fix:  If a tab contains a file, and the user cancelled the file open dialog
      the file icon was removed from the tab
Enh:  Searching and replacing text always took the entered value as a regular

      in the profile.
Fix:  The current workspace was not saved, when File->Disconnect was selected


Build 62, 15.11.2003

      when using an account which does not have privileges to do so.
      The indexes for Oracle are now retrieved with an own SQL statement
      rather then using the driver.
Fix:  When switching back to a panel which was currently executing a

      was not correct in the tab label
Enh:  Reworked SQL Macro handling. File->Manage Macros has been removed and
      merged with "SQL->SQL Macros->Run macro...". The combined functionality
      is now available under "SQL->Manage Macros..."
      The new Dialog also offers the possibility to replace the current editor
      text with the SQL text from the macro. When executing a macro by typing
      its name in the editor the text will still not be replaced

      workspace should be loaded.


Build 61, 02.11.2003
--------------------
Enh:  The default type which is selected in the drop down of the table
      list panel in the DbExplorer can be defined now. If this
      property is set, the dropdown will default to this selection
      when the DbExplorer is opened.
Fix:  When configuring several drivers with the same driver class (but
      different descriptions) the wrong jar file was used to retrieve

      driver when the Workbench tried to analyze the ResultSet metadata.
Fix:  Some SQL statements (like executing stored procedures or SHUTDOWN)
      could lead to an OutOfMemory error (this is due to a bug in most
      of the JDBC drivers. A workaround for retrieving the results in
      such cases prevents now the OutOfMemory error)

Fix:  The DbExplorer did not retrieve itself when it was opened as a tab
Enh:  Memory consumption for SaveAs (HTML, XML, TXT, SQL) has been reduced.
Enh:  The table search tab in the DbExplorer now tries to guess if the
      user is doing a case-insesitive search on databases which are

     for some statements


Build 56, 19.07.2003
--------------------
Enh: The help file is now included in Workbench.jar, thus the Help
     menu does not try to display the internet page any longer.
     Displaying the "plain" HTML file is a workaround, until the full
     JavaHelp is available


Build 55, 19.07.2003

     is now displayed next to the "Total:" label, to indicate that the SQL
     query is running.
Enh: The data tab in the DbExplorer is now using the same component as the SQL panel
     in the main window, thus the max row setting moved to the lower right corner

     to the database.
Fix: The table rowcount and data was retrieved too often in the DbExplorer
Enh: When spooling data to XML format, the date and number format can now

21.01.2003 Fix: When adding a new SQL tab, the Mnemonic would not be set correctly

18.01.2003 Fix: Changed the format of the SQL Statement history files to plain text
                for performance reasons. Starting the workbench with a large
                statement history would cause longer startup times due to the XML#
                parsing. Existing XML files will be automatically converted and
                deleted.
           Fix: Optimize column width shrinks columns with no values at all, as much
                as possible

16.01.2003 Fix: Enhance handling of huge script files
           Fix: Running multiple statements could not be cancelled.

15.01.2003 Enh: The command DESCRIBE is now also recognized as (not only DESC)
           Fix: Running a stored procedure with exec did not work in Oracle
