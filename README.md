# SQL Workbench/J

A fork from this fantastic SQL workbench

## Motivation

This is a powerful and useful project, for a regular basis work on SQL. Although it has a wide community and an active vcs, svn and ant seems a little odd this days and I feel not comfortable with that workflow. To improve or modify it I prefer git and maven management.

Anyway it will be a target for this fork to contribute upstream repo, so git-svn will be the base for development.
 
## Install

As this project is mavenized and some SQL engines are not on maven you need to install it yourself

Execute [install_no_maven_dependencies.sh](https://github.com/albfan/sqlworkbenchj/blob/master/libs/junit/install_no_maven_dependencies.sh) for that
