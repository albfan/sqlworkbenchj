  <p>LogMgr manages the logging in SQL Workbench/J.</p>
  <p>
    It acts as a facade to an actual WbLogger implementation.
    Depending on the configuration property <tt>workbench.log.log4j</tt> either a
    {@link workbench.log.SimpleLogger} or a {@link workbench.log.Log4JLogger} is created.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Log4J jar file is not part of the distribution, but is needed to compile the classes.
