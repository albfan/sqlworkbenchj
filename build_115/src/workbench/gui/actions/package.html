Actions used in the GUI frontend. 
Every Action is a descendant of {@link workbench.gui.actions.WbAction} that provides 
several utility functions to work with Actions.
Each WbAction will register itself with the {@link workbench.resource.ShortcutManager}, in order 
to allow a remapping of keyboard shortcuts.
Some actions are not created during startup, in this case they have to be 
registered with the Shortcut manager using the ActionRegistration class.
If that is not done, they won't be available in the "Configure shortcuts" dialog
which is implemented through {@link workbench.gui.settings.ShortcutEditor}
