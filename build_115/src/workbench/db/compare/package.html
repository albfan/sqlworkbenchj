Classes to compare the data from two tables. <br/>

{@link workbench.db.compare.TableDeleteSync} can delete rows from the target table that are not
present in the source table. Alternatively it can also write the generated the SQL statements 
to a Writer object instead of executing the statements.
<br/>
{@link workbench.db.compare.RowDataComparer} can be used to create SQL statements that would insert
a missing row or update an existing row in the target table.
