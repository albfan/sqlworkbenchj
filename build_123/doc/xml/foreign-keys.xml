		<title>Navigating referenced rows</title>
		<para>
			Once you have retrieved data from a table that has foreign key relations to
			other tables, you can navigate the relationship for specific rows in the result set.
			Select the rows for which you want to find the data in the related tables, then
			right click inside the result set. In the context menu two items are available:
			<simplelist columns="1">
				<member>Referenced rows</member>
				<member>Referencing rows</member>
			</simplelist>
		</para>
		<para>
			Consider the following tables:
			<simplelist columns="1">
				<member><literal>BASE(b_id, name)</literal> </member>
				<member><literal>DETAIL(d_id, base_id, description)</literal> with <literal>base_id</literal>
				referencing <literal>BASE(b_id)</literal> </member>
				<member><literal>MORE_DETAIL(md_id, detail_id, description)</literal> with <literal>detail_id</literal>
				referencing <literal>DETAIL(d_id)</literal></member>
			</simplelist>
		</para>


		<para>
			The context menu for the selected rows will give you the choice in
			which SQL tab you want the generated <literal>SELECT</literal> to be pasted. This is similar
			to the <link linkend="dbexplorer-select-data">Put SELECT into</link> feature in the table list
			of the DbExplorer.
		</para>

		<para>
			Once you have obtained a result set from the table <literal>BASE</literal>, select
			(mark) the rows for which you want to retrieve the related rows, e.g. the one where id=1. Using
			<menuchoice><guimenu>Referencing rows</guimenu><guimenuitem>DETAIL</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
			&wb-productname; will create the following statement:
<programlisting>SELECT *
FROM DETAIL
WHERE base_id = 1;</programlisting>
			The result of the generated statement will always be added to the existing results of the chosen
			SQL panel. By default the generated SQL statement will be appended to the text editor.
			If you don't want the generated statement to be appended to the editor,
			hold down the <literal>Ctrl</literal> key while selecting the desired menu item.
			In that case, the generated statement will only be written to the messages
			panel of the SQL tab. If the target tab contains an external file, the statement will never
			be appended to the editor's text.
		</para>


		<para>
			To navigate from the child data to the "parent" data, use
			<guimenu>Referenced rows</guimenu>
		</para>
		<para>
			The additional result tabs can be closed using
			<menuchoice><guimenu>Data</guimenu><guimenuitem>Close result</guimenuitem></menuchoice>

		<title>Generating JOIN conditions</title>
    <para>
      When using ANSI JOIN syntax to create table joins with tables linked by foreign keys in the database,
      the command <literal>JOIN completion</literal> can be used to automatically generate the necessary
      join condition. Consider the following statement
    </para>
    <para>
    <programlisting>
SELECT ord.amount, ord.order_date, prod.name
FROM orders ord
  JOIN product prod ON |</programlisting>(the | denoting the location of the cursor).</para>
    <para>
      When the cursor is located behind the <literal>ON</literal> keyword and you select
      <menuchoice><guimenu>SQL</guimenu><guimenuitem>JOIN completion</guimenuitem></menuchoice>, &wb-productname; will
      retrieve the foreign key and corresponding primary key definitions between the tables <literal>orders</literal> and
      <literal>product</literal>. If such constraints exist, the corresponding condition will be generated and
      written into the editor. After executing <guimenuitem>JOIN completion</guimenuitem>, the SQL statement will look like this:
    </para>
    <programlisting>SELECT ord.amount, ord.order_date, prod.name
FROM orders ord
  JOIN product prod ON prod.id = ord.product_id</programlisting>
    <para>
      This feature requires the usage of the JOIN keyword. Joining tables in the <literal>WHERE</literal> clause is not supported.
    </para>
    <para>
      By default &wb-productname; tries to create a join condition on the table from the "previous" <literal>JOIN</literal> condition
      (or the <literal>FROM</literal>) clause. If no foreign key constraint is found linking the "current" and the "previous" table,
      a popup window with all tables in the select statement that could be used for completion is displayed. This popup merely
      looks at the tables in the statement, no test for foreign key constraints is done when displaying this list.
    </para>
    <para>
      You can <link linkend="options-join-completion-using">configure</link> this feature to generate a <literal>USING</literal>
      operator if the column names match. The case of the keywords in the generated condition is determined by the settings
      of the <link linkend="options-sql-formatting">SQL Formatter</link>.
    </para>

  <section id="select-fk-values">
    <title>Selecting foreign key values in referencing tables</title>
    <para>
      &wb-productname; supports the selection of foreign key values (i.e. the primary key values of the referenced
      table) in two different situations: while editing a result set and while writing a DML statement.

      <para>
        After starting to edit a cell, the context menu contains an item <guimenuitem>Select FK value</guimenuitem>. Once this
        item is selected &wb-productname; will detect the table that the current column references. If a foreign
        key is detected a dialog window will be shown containing the data from the referenced table. For performance reasons
        the check if the current column is referencing another table is only done <emphasis>after</emphasis> the menu item has been invoked.
        If no foreign key could be found, a message is displayed in the status bar.
      </para>
      <note>
        <para>
          This is only supported for result sets that are based on a single table.

        configured through the "Max. Rows" input field.

              This mode is intended for small lookup tables. All rows are loaded into memory and the

        When invoking code-completion inside a DML (<literal>UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, SELECT</literal>) statement, an additional

        When that menu item is selected, the statement is analyzed and if the column of the current expression is
