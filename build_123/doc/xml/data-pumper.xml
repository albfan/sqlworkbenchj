		<title>Overview</title>

		<para>The export and import features are useful if you cannot connect to
			the source and the target database at once. If your source and target
			are both reachable at the same time, it is more efficient to use the DataPumper
			to copy data between two systems. With the DataPumper no intermediate
			files are necessary. Especially with large tables this can be an advantage.
		</para>

		<para>
			To open the DataPumper, select <menuchoice><guimenu>Tools</guimenu><guimenuitem>DataPumper</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
		</para>
		<para>The DataPumper lets you copy data from a single table (or SELECT
		query) to a table in the target database. The mapping between source columns
		and target columns can be specified as well</para>

		<para>Everything that can be done with the DataPumper, can also be accomplished
			with the <link linkend="command-copy"><literal>WbCopy</literal></link> command. The DataPumper can
			also generate a script which executes the <literal>WbCopy</literal> command with the correct parameters
			according to the current settings in the window. This can be used to create
			scripts which copy several tables.
		</para>

		<note><para>The DataPumper can also be started as a stand-alone application - without the
			main window - by specifying -datapumper=true in the command line when starting &wb-productname;.
		</para></note>
		<para>When opening the DatPumper from the main window, the main window's current connection
			will be used as the initial source connection. You can disable the automatic connection upon
			startup with the property <literal>workbench.datapumper.autoconnect</literal> in the <filename>workbench.settings</filename> file.
		</para>

	<section id="data-pumper-connecting">
		<title>Selecting source and target connection</title>

		<para>The DataPumper window is divided in three parts: the upper left part for
			defining the source of the data, the upper right part for defining the target, and
			the lower part to adjust various settings which influence the way, the data is copied.
		</para>

		<para>After you have opened the DataPumper window it will automatically connect
		the source to the currently selected connection from the main window. If the DataPumper
		is started as a separate application, no initial connection will be made.</para>

		<para>To select the source connection, press the ellipsis right next to the
		source profile label. The standard connection dialog will appear. Select the
		connection you want to use as the source, and click OK. The DataPumper will then
		connect to the database. Connecting to the target database works similar. Simply
		click on the ellipsis next to the target profile box.</para>
		<para>Instead of a database connection as the source, you can also select
			a text or XML file as the source for the DataPumper. Thus it can also
			be used as a replacement of the <link linkend="command-import">WbImport</link> command.
		</para>

		<para>The drop down for the target table includes an entry labeled "(Create new table)". For details
		on how to create a new table during the copy process please refer to the
		<link linkend="data-pumper-advanced-tasks">advanced tasks</link> section.</para>

		<para>After source and target connection are established you can specify the tables and
		define the column mapping between the tables.</para>
	</section>

	<section id="data-pumper-simple-task">

		<title>Copying a complete table</title>

		<para>To copy a single table select the source and target table in the dropdowns (which
		are filled as soon as the connection is established)</para>
		<para>After both tables are selected, the middle part of the window will
		display the available columns from the source and target table. This grid display
		represents the column mapping between source and target table.</para>

		<section id="column-mapping">
			<title>Mapping source to target columns</title>

			<para>Each row in the display maps a source column to a target column. Initially the DataPumper
				tries to match those columns which have the same name and data type. If no match is found
				for a target column, the source column will display <literal>(Skip target column)</literal>
				This means that the column from the target table will not be included when
				inserting data into the target table (technically speaking: it will be excluded from the column
				list in the INSERT statement).
			</para>
		</section>

		<section id="source-where">
			<title>Restricting the data to be copied</title>

			<para>You can restrict the number of rows to be copied by specifying a
				<literal>WHERE</literal> clause which will be used when retrieving the data from the source table.
				The <literal>WHERE</literal> clause can be entered in the SQL editor in the lower part
				of the window.
			</para>
		</section>

		<section id="delete-target">
			<title>Deleting all rows from the target table</title>

			<para>When you select the option "Delete target table", all rows from
				the target table will be deleted before the copy process is started.
				This is done with a <literal>DELETE FROM &lt;tablename&gt;;</literal>
				When you select this option, make sure the data can be deleted in this way,
				otherwise the copy process will fail.
			</para>
			<para>The <literal>DELETE</literal> will not be committed right away, but
				at the end of the copy process. This is obviously only of interest if
				the connection is not done with autocommit = true
			</para>
		</section>

		<section id="continue-error">
			<title>Continuing when an insert fails</title>

			<para>In some cases inserting of individual rows in the target table might
				fail (e.g. a primary key violation if the table is not empty). When selecting the
				option "Continue on error", the copy process will continue even if rows fail
				to insert
			</para>
		</section>

		<section id="commit-every">
			<title>Committing changes</title>
			<para>By default all changes are committed at the end, when all rows
			have been copied. By supplying a value in the field "Commit every"
			&wb-productname; will commit changes every time the specified number of
			rows has been inserted into the target. When a value of 50 rows has been
			specified, and the source table contains 175 rows, &wb-productname; will send
			4 <literal>COMMIT</literal>s to the target database. After inserting
			row 50, row 100, row 150 and after the last row.</para>
		</section>

		<section id="data-pumper-batchupdate">
			<title>Batch execution</title>
			<para>If the JDBC driver supports batch updates, you can enable the use of batch updates with
				this check box. The check box will be disabled, if the JDBC driver does not support batch updates,
				or if a combined update mode (insert,update, update,insert) is selected.
			</para>
			<para>Batch execution is only available if either INSERT or UPDATE mode is selected.</para>
		</section>

		<section id="data-pumper-update-mode">
			<title>Update mode</title>
			<para>Just like the <link linkend="command-import">WbImport</link> and
				<link linkend="command-copy">WbCopy</link> commands, the data pumper can
				optionally update the data in the target table. Select the approriate
				update strategy from the <literal>Mode</literal> drop down. The DataPumper
				will use the key columns defined in the column mapper to generate the <literal>UPDATE</literal>
				command. When using update you have to select at least one key column.
			</para>
			<para>You cannot use the update mode, if you select <emphasis role="strong">only</emphasis> key columns,
				The values from the source are used to build up the <literal>WHERE</literal> clause for the
				<literal>UPDATE</literal> statement. If ony key columns are defined, then there would be nothing to
				update.
			</para>
			<para>
				For maximum performance, choose the update strategy that will result in a successful
				first statement more often. As a rule of thumb:
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem><simpara>Use <literal>-mode=insert,update</literal>, if you expect more rows to be inserted then updated.</simpara></listitem>
					<listitem><simpara>Use <literal>-mode=update,insert</literal>, if you expect more rows to be updated then inserted.</simpara></listitem>
				</itemizedlist>

		<section id="dp-constants">
			<title>Populating a column with a constant</title>
			<para>To populate a target column with a constant value. The name
			of the source columns can be edited in order to supply a constant
			value instead of a column name. Any expression understood by the
			source database can be entered there. Note that if (Skip target column) is
			selected, the field cannot be edited.</para>

		<section id="create-target-table">
			<title>Creating the target table</title>
			<para>You can create the target table "on the fly" by selecting
				<literal>(Create&nbsp;target&nbsp;table)</literal> from the list of target tables.
				You will be prompted for the name of the new table. If you later want to use a different
				name for the table, click on the button to the right of the drop down.
			</para>
			<note><para>The target table will be created without any primary key definitions, indexes
			of foreign key constraints.</para></note>
			<para>The DataPumper tries to map the column types from the source columns to
				data types available on the target database. For this mapping it relies on information
				returned from the JDBC driver. The functions used for this may not be implemented fully
				in the driver. If you experience problems during the creation of the target tables, please
				create the tables manually before copying the data. It will work best if the source
				and target system are the same (e.g. PostgreSQL to PostgreSQL, Oracle to Oracle, etc).
			</para>
			<para>
				Most JDBC drivers map a single JDBC data type to more then one native datatype. MySql
				maps its <literal>VARCHAR</literal>, <literal>ENUM</literal> and <literal>SET</literal>
				type to java.sql.Types.VARCHAR. The DataPumper will take the first mapping
				which is returned by the driver and will ignore all subsequent ones. Any datatype
				that is returned twice by the driver is logged as a warning in the log file.
				The actual mappings used, are logged with type INFO.
			</para>

		<section id="source-query">
			<title>Using a query as the source</title>

			<para>If you want to copy the data from several tables into one
				table, you can use a SELECT query as the source of your data. To do this,
				select the option <literal>Use SQL query as source</literal> below the SQL editor.
				After you have entered you query into the editor, click the button
				<guibutton>Retrieve columns from query</guibutton>. The columns resulting from the
				query will then be put into the source part of the column mapping.
				Make sure, the columns are named uniquely when creating the query. If you select
				columns from different tables with the same name, make sure you use a column alias
				to rename the columns.
			</para>

			<para>Creating the target table "on the fly" is not available when using a SQL
