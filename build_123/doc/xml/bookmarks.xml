    <title>Defining bookmarks</title>
    <para>
      A bookmark inside the editor is defined by adding the keyword <literal>@WbTag</literal> followed by the name
      of the bookmark into a SQL comment:
    </para>
    <programlisting>-- @WbTag delete everything
truncate table orders,order_line,customers;
commit;
    </programlisting>
    <para>
      The keyword is not case sensitive, <literal>@wbtag</literal> will work just as wel as <literal>@WBTAG</literal>,
      or <literal>@WbTag</literal>. A multiline comment can be used as well as a single line comment.
    </para>
    <para>
      The annotations for <link linkend="result-names">naming a result</link> can additionally be
      included in the bookmark list. This is enabled in the <link linkend="option-result-name">options panel for the editor</link>.
    </para>
    <para>
      The names of procedures and functions can also be used as bookmarks if enabled in the <link linkend="bookmark-options">bookmark options</link>
    </para>

    <title>Jumping to a bookmark</title>
    <para>
      To jump to a bookmark select <menuchoice><guimenu>Tools</guimenu><guimenuitem>Bookmarks</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.
      A dialog box with all defined bookmarks will be displayed. You can filter the list of displayed bookmarks
      by entering a value in the input field. Depending on the option <guimenu>Filter on name only</guimenu>
      the value will either be compared only against the bookmark name. If that option is disabled then
      the bookmark name and the name of the SQL tab will be checked for the entered value.
    </para>
    <note><para>
      The selection in the bookmark list can be moved with the <keycap>UP/DOWN</keycap> keys even when
      the cursor is located in the filter input field.
    </para></note>
    <para>
      If the option <guimenu>Only for current tab</guimenu> is enabled, then the dialog will open showing
      only bookmarks for the current tab.

  <section id="bookmark-config">
    <title>Configuring the display of the bookmark list</title>
    <para>
      There are two options to influence how the list of bookmarks is displayed. Both options
      are available when displaying the context menu for the list header (usually through a
      click with the right mouse button):
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <simpara>
            Remember column widths - if this is enabled, the columns are not automatically adjusted to the
            width of the content. Instead the list remembers whatever width was adjusted.
          </simpara>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <simpara>
            Remember sort order - by default the list is sorted by the name of the bookmark.
            When this option is selected, whatever sort order is selected (by clicking on the
            column headers) will be saved and restored the next time the dialog is opened.
          </simpara>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
