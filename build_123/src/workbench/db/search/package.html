  Classes to search the contents of a database for a specific text (string).
  <br/>
  To search for data stored in tables (or views) two different implementations are available:
  <ul>
    <li>ClientSideTableSearcher - will read every each row into memory and use the functionality of the {@link workbench.storage.filter.ColumnComparator}
    to match text agains retrieved data. This will allow to search e.g. for number as well</li>
    <li>ServerSideTableSearcher - creates a SQL statement with a <tt>LIKE</tt> condition to find the search criteria. This limits the search
    to data types that can be compared with <tt>LIKE</tt> (mainly VARCHAR columns)</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  ObjectSourceSearch will search the source code of any object in the database for a specific string.
