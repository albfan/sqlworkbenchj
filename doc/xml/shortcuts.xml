		<para>
			To assign a (new) keyboard combination for a specific action, select (highlight) the action in the list
			and click on the <guibutton>Assign</guibutton> button. A small window will pop up, where you can
			press the key combination which you would like to assign to that action.
			Note that only F-Keys (F1, F2, ...) can be used without a modifier (Shift, Control, Alt). All other
			keys need be pressed together with one of the modifier keys.

		<para>After you have entered the desired keyboard shortcut, press the <guibutton>OK</guibutton> button.
			If the shortcut is already assigned to a different action, you will be prompted, if you want to
			override that definition. If you select to overwrite the shortcut for the other action, that
			action will then have <emphasis role="bold">no</emphasis> shortcut assigned
