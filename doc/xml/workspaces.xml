    <para>
      A workspace is a collection of editor tabs that group scripts or statements together. A workspace stores the
      name of each editor tab, the cursor position for each editor, the selection and the statement history.
    </para>
    <para>
      Each connection profile is associated with a workspace. If no workspace is explicitely chosen for a connection profile,
      a workspace with the name <literal>Default</literal> is used. If not specified otherwise, workspaces are stored
      in the <link linkend="config-dir">configuration directory</link>.
    </para>
    <para>
      A workspace file has the extension <literal>.wksp</literal> and is a regular ZIP archive that can be opened with
      any ZIP tool. It contains one text file for each editor in the workspace and some property files that
      store additional settings like the divider location, the <link linkend="max-rows-display">Max. Rows</link> value or the
      selected catalog and schema of the <link linkend="dbexplorer">DbExplorer</link>.
    </para>

    <note><para>
      It is recommended to use a different workspace for each connection profile.
    </para></note>

    <para>
      Workspaces can be used to reduce the number of editor tabs being used. You can create different workspaces
      for different topics you work on. One workspace that contains queries to monitor a database, one workspace
      that contains everything related to a specific feature you are working on, one workspace to initialize a
      new environment and so on.
    </para>

    <para>
      The workspace is saved when the window using that workspace is closed. If the option <link linkend="options-save-wksp">"Auto-Save workspace"</link>
      is enabled the workspace is automatically saved when a SQL statement is executed.
    </para>

  <section id="workspace-save-as">
    <title>Creating a copy of the current workspace</title>
    <para>
      To create a copy of the current workspace, use <menuchoice><guimenu>Workspace</guimenu><guimenuitem>Save workspace as</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
      After saving the workspace, the new workspace becomes the current workspace (the old one will not be changed).
      You will be asked if the new workspace should be the default profile's workspace, so that if you connect using
      that connection profile the new workspace will be loaded automatically.
    </para>
    <para>
      If the new workspace is not made the profile's workspace, the next time you connect using that connection profile,
      the old workspace file will be loaded.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you chose not to assign the new workspace right after saving it, you can later assign the currently
      loaded workspace to be used by the current connection profile using:
      <menuchoice><guimenu>Workspace</guimenu><guimenuitem>Assign Workspace</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.
    </para>
    <para>
      This feature can be used if you have a workspace that contains statements that you want to use for a new
      topic, but you don't want to lose the original set of statements (that were used for a previous work).
    </para>
  </section>

  <section id="workspace-load">
    <title>Load a different workspace</title>
    <para>
      If you want to load an existing workspace e.g. because you want to work on a different topic, you can use
      <menuchoice><guimenu>Workspace</guimenu><guimenuitem>Load Workspace</guimenuitem></menuchoice> Again you are
      asked if you want to use the newly loaded workspace as the default workspace.
    </para>
    <para>
      Workspaces loaded through this will be put into the <menuchoice><guimenu>Workspace</guimenu><guimenuitem>Recent Workspaces</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
      menu so that you can quickly switch between workspaces you often use.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you have a workspace loaded other than the default workspace of the current connection profile, you can
      quickly re-load the default workspace through
      <menuchoice><guimenu>Workspace</guimenu><guimenuitem>Re-Load Profile Workspace</guimenuitem></menuchoice> If you
      do that, the current workspace will be saved and the workspace assigned to the current connection profile
      will be loaded.
    </para>

  <section id="workspace-external-files">
    <title>Workspace and external files</title>
    <para>
      By default a workspace "remembers" the external files that were loaded. The content of the loaded file
      will also be stored in the workspace file. This can be configured in the <link linkend="options-workspace">Options dialog</link>.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section id="workspace-variables">
    <title>Workspace variables</title>
    <para>
      It is possible to setup <link linkend="using-variables">variables</link> that are automatically defined when the workspace is loaded.
      These variables will be removed when the workspace is closed or a different workspace is loaded.
    </para>
    <para>
      Variables defined in the workspace will overwrite variables defined in the <link linkend="profile-variables">connection profile</link>.
    </para>
