		JDBC drivers support additional connection properties where

    as part of the URL, but sometimes they need to be passed to the driver using
    a different method called extended properties.
	</para>

	<para>
		If you need to pass an additional parameter to your driver you can do that
		with the <guibutton>Extended Properties</guibutton> button. After clicking that
		button, a dialog will appear with a table that has two columns. The first column
		is the name of the property, the second column the value that you want to pass to

		<para>
			If this option is enabled, then each tab in the main window
      will open a separate (phyiscal) connection to the database server. This is
			useful, if the JDBC driver is not multi-threaded and does not allow
			to execute two statements concurrently on the same connection.
		</para>

		<para>
			The connection for each tab will not be opened until the tab
			is actually selected.
		</para>
		<para>
			Enabling this option has impact on transaction handling as well. If
			only one connection for all tabs (including the <link linkend="dbexplorer">Database Explorer</link>)
			is used, then a transaction that is started in one tab is "visible" to all other tabs
			(as they share the same connection). Changes done in one tab via <literal>UPDATE</literal>
			are seen in all other tabs (including the Database Explorer).
			If a separate connection is used for each tab, then each tab will have its own

			course)
		</para>

		<para>If you intend to execute several statements in parallel then it's strongly

				If an alternate delimiter is defined, and the statement that is executed ends with the
  			defined delimiter, this one will be used instead of the standard semicolon. The profile
				setting will overwrite the global setting for this connection. This way you can
				define the <literal>GO</literal> keyword for SQL Server connections, and use
				the forward slash in Oracle connections.
        Please refer to <link linkend="understand-alternate-delim">using the alternate delimiter</link>

		<section id="profile-workspace-file">
			<title>Workspace</title>

			<para>
				For each connection profile, a workspace file can (and should) be assigned. When you
				create a new connection, you can either leave this field empty or supply a name for a new profile.
			</para>
			<para>
				If the profile that you specify does not exist, you will be prompted
				if you want to create a new file, load a different workspace or want to
				ignore the missing file. If you choose to ignore, the association
				with the workspace file will be cleared and the default workspace will be loaded.
			</para>
			<para>
				If you choose to leave the workspace file empty, or ignore the missing
				file, you can later save your workspace to a new file. When you do that,
				you will be prompted if you want to assign the new workspace to the current
				connection profile.
			</para>
			<para>
				To save you current workspace choose
				<menuchoice><guimenu>Workspace</guimenu><guimenuitem>Save Workspace as</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
				to create a new workspace file.
			</para>

			<para>
				If you specify a filename that does not contain a directory or is a relative filename, it is assumed
        the workspace is stored in <link linkend="config-dir">configuration directory</link>.
			</para>

			<note><para>
				As the workspace stores several settings that are related to the connection
				(e.g. the selected schema in the <link linkend="dbexplorer">DbExplorer</link>) it is recommended to create one
				workspace for each connection profile.

    <section id="profile-tags">
      <title>Tagging connection profiles</title>
      <para>
        To organize a large number of profiles it is possible to supply tags for each profile. These tags are
        then used by the <link linkend="connection-profile-quickfilter">profile filter</link> to quickly show only certain profiles.
      </para>
      <para>
        The tags for a profile are entered as a comma separated list. To see a list of already defined tags,
        press <keycap>Ctrl-Space</keycap> in the input field.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="profile-icon">
      <title>Main window icon</title>
      <para>
        You can assign an icon file for each connection profile. The icon will then be used for the main window
        instead of the default application icon.
      </para>
      <para>
        The icon file can <emphasis role="bold">only</emphasis> be a <literal>png</literal> or <literal>gif</literal> file.
      </para>
      <para>
        Do <emphasis role="bold">not</emphasis> use an animated GIF file because that will hang the application!
      </para>
      <para>
        At least one file with an icon of 16x16 pixel should be selected. You can select multiple files with different
        icon sizes (e.g. a 16x16 and a 32x32 icon). Whether or not the additional sizes (i.e. bigger than 16x16)
        will be used depends on your operating system and desktop theme.

		<section id="profile-connect-scripts">
			<title>Connect scripts</title>

			<para>
				You can define a SQL script that is executed immediately after a connection for this
				profile has been established, and a script that is executed before a connection
				is about to be closed. To define the scripts, click on the button <guibutton>Connect scripts</guibutton>.
				A new window will be opened that contains two editors. Enter the script that should be
				executed upon connecting into the upper editor, the script to be executed before
				disconnecting into the lower editor. You can put more than one statement into the
				scripts. The statements have to be separated by a semicolon.
			</para>
			<para>
				The statements that are executed will be logged in the message panel of the
				SQL panel where the connection is created. You will not see the log when
				a connection for the DbExplorer is created.
			</para>
			<para>
				Execution of the script will stop at the first statement that throws an error.
				The error message will also be logged to the message panel. If the connection
				is made for a DbExplorer panel, the errors will only be visible in the log file.

			<simplesect id="profile-keep-alive">
				<title>Keep alive script</title>

				<para>
					Some DBMS are configured to disconnect an application that has been idle
					for some time. You can define an idle time and a SQL statement that is executed
					when the connection has been idle for the defined interval. This is also available
					when clicking on the <guibutton>Connect scripts</guibutton>.
				</para>

				<para>
					The keep alive statement can not be a script, it can only be a <emphasis role="bold">single</emphasis>
					SQL statement (e.g. <literal>SELECT version()</literal> or <literal>SELECT 42 FROM dual</literal>).
					You may not enter the trailing semicolon.
				</para>

				<para>
					The idle time is defined im milliseconds, but you can also enter the
					interval in seconds or minutes by appending the letter 's' (for seconds)
					or 'm' (for minutes) to the value.
					e.g.: <literal>30000</literal> (30 seconds), or <literal>45s</literal> (45 seconds), or
					<literal>10m</literal> (10 minutes).
				</para>
				<para>
					You can disable the keep alive
					feature by deleting the entry for the interval but keeping the SQL statement.
					Thus you can quickly turn off the keep alive feature but keep the
					SQL statement for the next time.

    <section id="profile-filters">
      <title>Schema and Catalog filters</title>
      <para>
        If your database contains a lot of schema or catalogs that you don't want to be listed in the dropdown
        of the <link linkend="dbexplorer">DbExplorer</link>, you can define filter expressions to hide certain entries.
      </para>
      <para>
        The filters are defined by clicking on the <guibutton>Schema/Catalog Filter</guibutton> button.
        The filter dialog contains two input fields, one to filter schema name and one to filter catalog names.
      </para>
      <para>
        Each line of the filter definition defines a single regular expression of schema/catalog names to be <emphasis>excluded</emphasis>
        from the dropdown, i.e. if a schema/catalog matches the defined name, it will not be listed in the dropdown.
      </para>
      <para>
        The filter items are treated as regular expressions, so the standard SQL wildcards will not work here. The basic
        expression is just a name (e.g. MDSYS). Comparison is always done case-insensitive. So <emphasis>mdsys</emphasis>
        and <emphasis>MDSYS</emphasis> will achieve the same thing.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you want to filter all schemas that start with a certain value, the regular expression would be:
        <literal>^pg_toast.*</literal>. Note the dot followed by a * at the end. In a regular expression the dot matches
        any character, and the * will allow any number of characters to follow. The ^ specifies that the whole string must
        occur at the beginning of the value.
      </para>
      <para>
        The regular expression must match completely in order to exclude the value from the drop down.
      </para>
      <para>

    <title>Using the quick filter</title>
    <para>
      The behaviour of the quick filter depends on whether <link linkend="profile-tags">tags</link> are defined or not.
    </para>
    <para>
      If no tags are defined at all, the quick filter will only search in the profile name. The search
      is done case-insensitive. Search for <literal>prod</literal> will match any profile that has
      <literal>PROD</literal> or <literal>prod</literal> anywhere in the profile's name
    </para>
    <para>
      If tags are defined, the input is first checked if its one or more tags. If that is the case,
      the profiles are only filtered based on the tags defined. If there is a tag named <link>prod</link>,
      and the filter value is <literal>prod</literal>, only profiles with that tag are displayed. The profile
      name is not taken into account then. If the value in the filter field is not a tag,
      then the profiles are filtered based on name.
    </para>
    <para>
      Multiple tags are separated by a comma. To see a list of defined tags, press the <keycap>Ctrl-Space</keycap> key.
