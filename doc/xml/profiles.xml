	<title>Connection profiles</title>
	<para>&wb-productname; uses the concept of profiles to store
    connection information. A connection profile stores two different types
		of settings:

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><simpara>JDBC related properties such as the JDBC driver class, the connection URL, the username etc.</simpara></listitem>
			<listitem><simpara>&wb-productname; related properties such as the profile name the associated workspace, etc.</simpara></listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
	</para>

	<para>
		After the program is started, you are prompted to choose a
		connection profile to connect to a database. The dialog will display a list
		of available profiles on the left side. When selecting a profile, its details
		(JDBC and &wb-productname; settings) are displayed on the right side of the
		window.
	</para>

    To create a new profile click on the
		<literal>New Profile</literal> button (<guiicon><inlinegraphic width="16" depth="16" fileref="@IMAGE_DIR@/NewProfile16.gif" format="GIF"/></guiicon>).
		This will create a new profile with the name "New Profile". The new profile
		will be created in the currently active group.
		The other properties will be empty. To create a copy of the currently
		selected profile click on the <literal>Copy Profile</literal> button
		(<guiicon><inlinegraphic width="16" depth="16" fileref="@IMAGE_DIR@/CopyProfile16.gif" format="GIF"/></guiicon>).
		The copy will be created in the current group. If you want to place the copy

<section id="profile-groups">
	<title>Managing profile groups</title>
	<para>
		Profiles can be organized in groups, so you can group them by type (test, integration, production)
		or customer or database system. When you start &wb-productname; for the first time,
		no groups are created and the tree will only display the default group node.
		To add a new group click on the <literal>Add profile group</literal>
		(<guiicon><inlinegraphic width="16" depth="16" fileref="@IMAGE_DIR@/NewFolder16.gif" format="GIF"/></guiicon>)
		button. The new group will be appended at the end of the tree. If you create a new profile, it will
		be created in the currently selected group. If a profile is selected in the tree and not a group
		node, the new profile will be created in the group of the currently selected profile.
	</para>

	<note><para>
			Empty groups are discarded (i.e. not saved) when you restart &wb-productname;
	</para></note>

	<para>
		You can move profiles from one group to another but right clicking on the profile, then choose
		<guimenuitem>Cut</guimenuitem>. Then right-click on the target group and select
		<guimenuitem>Paste</guimenuitem> from the popup menu. If you want to put the profile
		into a new group that is not yet created, you can choose <guimenuitem>Paste to new folder</guimenuitem>.
		You will be prompted to enter the new group name.
	</para>
	<para>
		If you choose <guimenuitem>Copy</guimenuitem> instead of <guimenuitem>Cut</guimenuitem>,
		a copy of the selected profile will be pasted into the target group. This is similar to
		copying the currently selected profile.
	</para>

	<para>
		To rename a group, select the node in the tree, then press the <guibutton>F2</guibutton> key.
		You can now edit the group name.

		To delete a group, simply remove all profiles from that group. The group will then automatically
		be removed.

	<para>
		JDBC drivers support additional connection properties where
		you can fine tune the behaviour of the driver or enable special features
		that are not switched on by default. Most drivers support passing properties
    as part of the URL, but sometimes they need to be passed to the driver using
    a different method called extended properties.
	</para>

	<para>
		If you need to pass an additional paramter to your driver you can do that
		with the <guibutton>Extended Properties</guibutton> button. After clicking that
		button, a dialog will appear with a table that has two columns. The first column
		is the name of the property, the second column the value that you want to pass to
		the driver.
	</para>

	<para>
		To create a new property click on the new button. A new row will be inserted
		into the table, where you can define the property. To edit an existing property,
		simply doubleclick in the table cell that you want to edit. To delete an existing property
		click on the <literal>Delete</literal> button
		(<guiicon><inlinegraphic width="16" depth="16" fileref="@IMAGE_DIR@/Delete16.gif" format="GIF"/></guiicon>).
	</para>

  <para>
    Some driver require those properties to be so called "System properties" (see the manual

		<para>
			If this option is enabled, then each tab in the main window
      will open a separate (phyiscal) connection to the database server. This is
			useful, if the JDBC driver is not multi-threaded and does not allow
			to execute two statements concurrently on the same connection.
		</para>

		<para>
			The connection for each tab will not be opened until the tab
			is actually selected.
		</para>
		<para>
			Enabling this option has impact on transaction handling as well. If
			only one connection for all tabs (including the <link linkend="dbexplorer">Database Explorer</link>)
			is used, then a transaction that is started in one tab is "visible" to all other tabs
			(as they share the same connection). Changes done in one tab via <literal>UPDATE</literal>
			are seen in all other tabs (including the Database Explorer).
			If a separate connection is used for each tab, then each tab will have its own
			transaction context. Changes done in one tab will not be visible in other
			tabs until they are committed (depending on the isolation level of the database of
			course)
		</para>

		<para>If you intend to execute several statements in parallel then it's strongly
			recommended to use one connection for each tab. Most JDBC drivers are not multi-threaded

			but it is still possible to lock the GUI when running multiple statements on
			the same connection
		</para>
		<para>
			When you disable the use of separate connections per tab, you can still
			create new a (physical) connection for the current tab later, by selecting
			<menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>New Connection</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.

      <para>
        The filters are defined by clicking on the <guibutton>Schema/Catalog Filter</guibutton> button.
        The filter dialog contains two input fields, one to filter schema name and one to filter catalog names.
      </para>
      <para>
        Each line of the filter definition defines a single regular expression of schema/catalog names to be <emphasis>excluded</emphasis>
        from the dropdown, i.e. if a schema/catalog matches the defined name, it will not be listed in the dropdown.
      </para>
      <para>
        The filter items are treated as regular expressions, so the standard SQL wildcards will not work here. The basic
        expression is just a name (e.g. MDSYS). Comparison is always done case-insensitive. So <emphasis>mdsys</emphasis>
        and <emphasis>MDSYS</emphasis> will achieve the same thing.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you want to filter all schemas that start with a certain value, the regular expression would be:
        <literal>^pg_toast.*</literal>. Note the dot followed by a * at the end. In a regular expression the dot matches
        any character, and the * will allow any number of characters to follow. The ^ specifies that the whole string must
        occur at the beginning of the value.
      </para>
      <para>
        The regular expression must match completely in order to exlude the value from the dropdown.
      </para>

			In the profile dialog, click on the <guibutton>Extended Properties</guibutton> button.
			Add a new property in the following window with the name <literal>internal_logon</literal>
