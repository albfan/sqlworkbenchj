  <para>
    &wb-productname; will split statements based on the SQL terminator <literal>;</literal> and send each statement unaltered to the DBMS.
  </para>

  <para>
    When executing statements such as <literal>CREATE PROCEDURE</literal> which in turn contain valid SQL statements, delimited with a <literal>;</literal>
    the &wb-productname; will send everything up to the first semicolon to the  backend (because the <literal>;</literal> terminates the SQL statement)
    In case of a <literal>CREATE PROCEDURE</literal> statement this will obviously result in an error as the statement is not complete.
  </para>
  <para>
    To be able to run DDL statements with embedded <literal>;</literal> characters, &wb-productname; needs to
    know where a statements ends. To specify the end of a statement with embedded <literal>;</literal> the so called
    "alternate delimiter" is used. This chapter describes how the alternate delimiter is used by &wb-productname;

  <section id="delimiter-postgres">
    <title>PostgreSQL</title>
    <para>
      The body of a function in Postgres is a character literal. Because a delimiter inside
      a character literal does not define the end of the statement, no special treatment is needed for Postgres.
    </para>

  <section id="delimiter-oracle">
    <title>Oracle PL/SQL</title>
    <para>
      This is an example of a <literal>CREATE PROCEDURE</literal> which will
      <emphasis role="bold">NOT</emphasis> work due to the embedded semicolon in
      the procedure source itself.
    </para>
    <programlisting>CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION proc_sample RETURN INTEGER
IS
  l_result INTEGER;
BEGIN
  SELECT max(col1) INTO l_result FROM sometable;
  RETURN l_result;
END;</programlisting>

    <para>
      When executing this script, Oracle would return an error because &wb-productname; will
      send everything up to the keyword <literal>INTEGER</literal> to the database. Obviously that
      fragment would not be correct.
    </para>

    <para>
      The solution is to terminate the script with a character sequence that is called the "<link linkend="profile-alternate-delimiter">alternate delimiter</link>"
      which can be defined in the connection profile. To be compatible with SQL Developer and SQL*Plus it is recommended to set the
      alternate delimiter to a forward slash (<literal>/</literal>).
    </para>

    <para>The script needs to be written like this:</para>
    <programlisting>CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION proc_sample RETURN INTEGER
IS
  l_result INTEGER;
BEGIN
  SELECT max(col1) INTO l_result FROM sometable;
  RETURN l_result;
END;
/</programlisting>

    <para>
      Note the trailing forward slash (<literal>/</literal>) at the end in order to "turn on" the
      use of the alternate delimiter. If you run scripts with embedded semicolons and you get
      an error, please verify the setting for your alternate delimiter.
    </para>

    <para>
      The standard delimiter (the semicolon) and the alternate delimiter
      can be mixed in a single script. Whenever a PL/SQL block (either a stored procedure or
      an anonymous block) is encountered, &wb-productname; expects the alternated delimiter to
      terminate that block. This follows the same rules
      <ulink url="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/server.112/e16604/ch_four.htm#i1039663">as used in SQL*Plus</ulink>.
    </para>

    <para>
      The following script will therefore work when connected to an Oracle database:
    </para>

    <programlisting>drop table sometable cascade constraints;
create table sometable
(
  col1 integer not null
);

create or replace function proc_sample return integer
is
  l_result integer;
begin
  select max(col1) into l_result from sometable;
  return l_result;
end;
/</programlisting>

  <section id="delimiter-other">
    <title>Other DBMS</title>
    <para id="alternate-delimiter-usage"><emphasis role="bold">When is the alternate delimiter used?</emphasis></para>

    <para>
      For all other DBMS, the use of the alternate delimiter is defined by the <emphasis role="bold">last delimiter</emphasis>
      used in the script.
    </para>
    <para>
      As soon as the statement (or script) that you execute ends with the alternate delimiter, the alternate delimiter
      is used to separate all SQL statements. When you execute selected text from the editor, be sure to select the
      alternate delimiter as well, otherwise it will not be recognized (if the alternate delimiter is not selected,
      the statement to be executed does not end with the alternate delimiter).
    </para>

    <para>
      This means a script must use the alternate delimiter for <emphasis role="bold">all</emphasis> statements in the
      script. The following script will not work, because the last statement is terminated with the alternate
      delimiter and thus &wb-productname; assumes <emphasis>all</emphasis> statements are delimited with that.
      As the <literal>CREATE TABLES</literal> statements are delimited with the standard delimiter, they are
      not recognized as a separate statement and thus the script is sent as a single statement to the server.
