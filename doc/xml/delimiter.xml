  <para>
    &wb-productname; will send the contents of the editor unaltered to the DBMS, so
    executing DDL statements (<literal>CREATE TABLE</literal>, ...) is possible.
  </para>

  <para>
    However when executing statements such as <literal>CREATE PROCEDURE</literal> which
    in turn contain valid SQL statement, delimited with a ; the &wb-productname;
    will send everything up to the first semicolon to the
    backend. In case of a <literal>CREATE PROCEDURE</literal> statement this will obviously
    result in an error as the statement is not complete.
  </para>

  <para>
    This is an example of a <literal>CREATE PROCEDURE</literal> which will
    <emphasis role="bold">not</emphasis> work due to the embedded semicolon in
    the procedure source itself.
  </para>
  <programlisting>CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION proc_sample RETURN INTEGER
IS
result INTEGER;
BEGIN
SELECT max(col1) INTO result FROM sometable;
RETURN result;
END;</programlisting>

  <para>
    When executing this script, Oracle would return an error because &wb-productname; will
    send everything up to the keyword <literal>INTEGER</literal> to the database. Obviously that
    fragment would not be correct.
  </para>

  <para>
    The solution is to terminate the script with a character
    sequence called the "<link linkend="options-alternate-delimiter">alternate delimiter</link>".
    The value of this sequence can be configured in the <link linkend="options">options dialog</link>
    as a global default, or per <link linkend="profile-alternate-delimiter">connection profile</link>
    (so you can use different alternate delimiters for different database systems).
    The default is the forward slash <emphasis role="bold">/</emphasis> defined as a single
    line delimiter.
  </para>

  <para>
    If a SQL statement is terminated with the alternate delimiter on a single line,
    that delimiter is used instead of a semicolon. This way the semicolons embedded in
    <literal>CREATE PROCEDURE</literal> statements will be sent correctly to the backend
    DBMS.
  </para>

  <para>So the solution to the above problem is the following script:</para>
  <programlisting>CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION proc_sample RETURN INTEGER
IS
result INTEGER;
BEGIN
SELECT max(col1) INTO result FROM sometable;
RETURN result;
END;
/</programlisting>

  <para>
    Note the trailing forward slash (<literal>/</literal>) at the end in order to "turn on" the
    use of the alternate delimiter. If you run scripts with embedded semicolons and you get
    an error, please verify the setting for your alternate delimiter.
  </para>

  <para id="alternate-delimiter-usage"><emphasis role="bold">When is the alternate delimiter used?</emphasis></para>
  <para>
    As soon as the statement (or script) that you execute is terminated with the
    alternate delimiter, the alternate delimiter is used to separate the individual
    SQL statements. When you execute selected text from the editor, be sure to
    select the alternate delimiter as well, otherwise it will not be
    recognized (if the alternate delimiter is not selected, the statement to be executed
    does not end with the alternate delimiter).
  </para>
  <note>
    <para>
    You cannot mix the standard semicolon and the alternate delimiter inside
    a single script.
    </para>
  </note>

  <para>
    If you use the alternate delimiter (by terminating the whole script with it), then
    <emphasis role="bold">all</emphasis> statements have to be delimited with it.
    You cannot mix the the standard semicolon and the alternate delimiter for one execution.
    The following statement (when executed as a complete scrip) would produce an error message:
  </para>
  <programlisting>SELECT sysdate FROM DUAL;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION proc_sample RETURN INTEGER
IS
result INTEGER;
BEGIN
SELECT max(col1) INTO result FROM sometable;
RETURN result;
END;
/</programlisting>

  <para>
    &wb-productname; will use the alternate delimiter which terminates the script. Thus the whole script
    will be seen as a <emphasis role="bold">single</</emphasis> statement - which of course is invalid.
    You will need to either select and run each statement individually or change the delimiter
    after the <literal>SELECT</literal> to the alternate delimiter.
  </para>
