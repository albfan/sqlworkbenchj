	<para>
		At the top of the window, the current schema and/or catalog can be selected. Whether both drop downs
		are available depends on the current DBMS. For Microsoft SQL Server, both the schema and the database
		can be changed. The labels next to the drop down are retrieved from the JDBC driver and should reflect
		the terms used for the current DBMS (Schema for PostgreSQL and Oracle, Owner and Database for SQL Server,
		Database for MySQL).
	</para>

	<para>
		The displayed list can be filtered using the quick filter above the list. To filter
		the list by the object name, simply enter the criteria in the filter field, and
		press <literal>ENTER</literal> or click the filter icon
		<guibutton><guiicon><inlinegraphic width="16" depth="16" fileref="@IMAGE_DIR@/filter16.png" format="PNG"/></guiicon></guibutton>.
		The criteria field will list the last 25 values that were entered in the drop down.
		If you want to filter based on a different column of the list, right-click on the
		criteria field, and select the desired column from the <literal>Filtercolumn</literal>
		menu item of the popup menu. The same filter can be applied on the <literal>Procedures</literal>
		tab.
	</para>

  <!--
	<para>
		The list of tables can be pre-filtered to remove unwanted entries such as tables
		that have been deleted and now reside in Oracle's "Recycle Bin". The filtering
		is done through a <link linkend="db-settings-filter-tables">regular expression</link>
		on a per-database basis. By default this is only defined for Oracle and will filter out
		any table that starts with <literal>BIN$</literal>.
	</para>
  -->

	<para>
		Synonyms are displayed if the current DBMS supports them.
		You can filter out unwanted synonyms by <link linkend="db-oracle-filter-syns">specifying a
		regular expression</link> in your <literal>workbench.settings</literal> file.
		This filter will also be applied when displaying the list of available tables when opening
		the <link linkend="command-completion">command completion</link> popup.
	</para>

	<para>
		The first tab displays the structure of tables and views. The type
		of object displayed can be chosen from the drop down right above the table
		list. This list will be returned by the JDBC driver, so the available
		"Table types" can vary from DBMS to DBMS.
	</para>

		The menu item <guimenuitem>Database Explorer</guimenuitem> will either display the explorer
	  as a new window or a new panel, depending on the <link linkend="options-explorer-as-tab">system options</link>.

			When displaying the data for a table, &wb-productname; generates a <literal>SELECT</literal>

		<para>

			For each DBMS you can define an expression for specific data types that are used when
			building the <literal>SELECT</literal> statement.

		<para>
			To configure this, you need to add one line per data type and DBMS to the file
			<literal>workbench.settings</literal>:
			<programlisting>workbench.db.[dbid].selectexpression.[type]=expression(${column})</programlisting>
			When building the <literal>SELECT</literal> statement, the placeholder <literal>${column}</literal>

		<para>
			<literal>[type]</literal> is the datatype of the column without any brackets or parameters:
			<literal>varchar</literal> instead of <literal>varchar(10)</literal>, or <literal>number</literal>
			instead of <literal>number(10,2)</literal>
		</para>
		<para>
			To convert e.g. the <literal>geometry</literal> datatype of Postgres to a readable format,
			one would use the following expression <literal>astext(transform(geo_column,4326))</literal>.
		</para>
		<para>
			To tell the DbExplorer to replace the retrieval of columns of type <literal>geometry</literal>
			in PostgreSQL with the above expression, the following line in <literal>workbench.settings</literal>
			is necessary:
			<programlisting>workbench.db.postgres.selectexpression.geometry=astext(transform(${column},4326)) </programlisting>

      Note that the data of columns that have been "converted" through this mechanism, might not be updateable any more. If

    </para>
		<para>
			The column name (as displayed in the result set) will usually be generated by the DBMS and will most probably not
      contain the real column name. In order to see the real column name you can supply a column alias in the configuration.
			<programlisting>workbench.db.oracle.selectexpression.xmltype=extract(${column}, '/').getClobVal() AS ${column}</programlisting>
      In order for &wb-productname; to parse the SQL statement correctly, the <literal>AS</literal> keyword
      <emphasis role="bold">must</emphasis> be used.

		<para>
			You can check the generated SELECT statement by using the

		<para>
			This tab offers the ability to search for a value in all text
			columns of all tables which are selected. The results will be displayed
			on the right side of that tab. The result will always display the
			complete row where the search value was found. Any column that contains
			the entered value will be highlighted.
		</para>

    <note>
      <para>
        The results displayed here are not editable. If you want to
        modify the results after a search, you have to use the
        <link linkend="command-search-data">WbGrepData</link> command
      </para>
    </note>
    <para>
      Two different implementations of the search are available: server side and client side.
    </para>

    <section id="search-table-server">
      <title>Server side search</title>

      <para>
        To server side search is enabled by selecting the check box labeled
        "<literal>Server side search</literal>".
      </para>

      <para>
        The value will be used to create a <literal>LIKE &apos;value&apos;</literal>
        restriction for each text column on the selected tables. Therefore the
        value should contain a wildcard, otherwise the exact expression will be
        searched.
      </para>

      <para>
        You can apply a function to each column as well. This is useful if
        you want to to do a case insensitive search on Oracle (Oracles VARCHAR
        comparison is case sensitive). In the entry field for the column the
        placeholder $col$ is replaced with the actual column name during the
        search. To do a case insensitive search in Oracle, you would enter
        lower($col$) in the column field and &apos;%test%&apos; in the value
        field.
      </para>

      <para>
        The expression in the column field is sent to the DBMS without
        changes, except the replacement of $col$ with the current column name.
        The above example would yield a <literal>lower(&lt;column_name&gt;) like
        &apos;%test%&apos;</literal> for each text column for the selected tables.
      </para>

      <para>
        The generated SQL statements are logged in the second tab, labeled
        <literal>SQL Statements</literal>.
      </para>

      <para>
        In the resulting tables, &wb-productname; tries to highlight those columns
        which match the criteria. This might not always work, if you apply a function to the
        column itself such as <literal>to_upper()</literal> &wb-productname; does not know
        that this will result in a case-insensitive search on the database. &wb-productname; tries to
        guess if the given function/value combination might result in a case insensitive search (especially
        on a DBMS which does a case sensitive search by default) but this might not work
        in all the cases and for all DBMS.
      </para>

      <para>
        The <literal>SELECT</literal> statement that is built to display the table's
        data will list all columns from the table. If the table contains BLOB columns
        this might lead to a substantial memory consumption. To avoid loading too
        many data into memory, you can check the option "Do not retrieve LOB columns".
        In that case columns of type CLOB or BLOB will not be retrieved.
      </para>

      <para>
        &wb-productname; is building a <literal>SELECT</literal> that "searches" for
        data using a <literal>LIKE</literal> expression. Only columns of type <literal>CHAR</literal>
        and <literal>VARCHAR</literal> are included in the LIKE search, because that is what
        most DBMS support. If the DBMS you are using supports <literal>LIKE</literal> expressions
        for other datatypes as well, you can <link linkend="dbexplorer-searchable-types">configure</link>
        this datatypes to be included in the search feature of the DbExplorer.
      </para>

    <section id="table-search-client">
      <title>Client side search</title>
      <para>
        To client side search is enabled by un-checking the check box labeled
        "<literal>Server side search</literal>".
      </para>
      <para>
        The client side search retrieves every row from the server,
        compares the retrieved values for each row and keeps the rows where
        at least one column matches the defined search criteria.
      </para>

      <para>
        As opposed to the server side search, this means that <emphasis role="bold">every</emphasis>
        row from the selected table(s) will be sent from the database server to the application.
        For large tables were only a small number of the rows will match the search value this can
        increase the processing time substantially.
      </para>
      <para>
        As the searching is done on the client side, this means that it can also "search" data types
        that cannot be using for a <literal>LIKE</literal> query such as <literal>CLOB, DATE, INTEGER</literal>.
      </para>
      <para>
        The search criteria is defined similar to the definition of a <link linkend="filter-data">filter</link> for a
        result set. For every column, its value will be converted to a character representation. The resulting
        string value will then be compared according to the defined comparator and the entered
        search value. If at least one column's value matches, the row will be displayed.
        The comparison is always done in a case-insensitively. The contents of BLOB columns will never be searched.
      </para>

      <para>
        The character representation that is used is based on the default formatting
        options from the <link linkend="">Options Window</link>. This means that e.g.
        a DATE column will be compared according to the standard formatting options
        before the comparison is done.
      </para>

      <para>
        The client side search is also available through the
        <link linkend="command-search-data">WbGrepData</link> command
      </para>
