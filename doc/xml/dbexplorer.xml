	</para>

	<para>
		At the top of the window, the current schema and/or catalog can be selected. Whether both dropdowns
		are available depends on the current DBMS. For Microsoft SQL Server, both the schema and the database
		can be changed. The labels next to the dropdown are retrieved from the JDBC driver and should reflect
		the terms used for the current DBMS (Schema for Postgres and Oracle, Owner and Database for SQL Server,
		Database for MySQL).
	</para>
  
	<para>
		The displayed list can be filtered using the quick filter above the list. To filter
		the list by the object name, simply enter the criteria in the filter field, and 
		press <literal>ENTER</literal> or click the filter icon
		<guiicon><inlinegraphic width="16" depth="16" fileref="@IMAGE_DIR@/filter16.gif" format="GIF"/></guiicon>.
		The criteria field will list the last 25 values that were entered in the dropdown.
		If you want to filter based on a different column of the list, right-click on the 
		criteria field, and select the desired column from the <literal>Filtercolumn</literal>
		menu item of the popup menu. The same filter can be applied on the <literal>Procedures</literal>
		tab.
	</para>
	
	<para>
		The list of tables can be pre-filtered to remove unwanted entries such as tables 
		that have been deleted and now reside in Oracle's "Recycle Bin". The filtering
		is done through a <link linkend="db-settings-filter-tables">regular expression</link> 
		on a per-database basis. By default this is only defined for Oracle and will filter out 
		any table that starts with <literal>BIN$</literal>.
	</para>
	
	<para>
		Synonyms are displayed if the current DBMS supports them.
		You can filter out unwanted synonyms by <link linkend="db-oracle-filter-syns">specifying a 
		regular expression</link> in your <literal>workbench.settings</literal> file. 
		This filter will also be applied when displaying the list of available tables when opening
		the <link linkend="command-completion">command completion</link> popup.
	</para>
  
	<para>
		The first tab displays the structure of tables and views. The type
		of object displayed can be chosen from the drop down right above the table
		list. This list will be returned by the JDBC driver, so the available
		"Table types" can vary from DBMS to DBMS.
	</para>

	<para>
		The menu item <guimenuitem>Database Explorer</guimenuitem> will either display the explorer
	  as a new window or a new panel, depending on the <link linkend="options-explorer-as-tab">system options</link>.
		If a DbExplorer is already open (either a window or a tab), the existing one is made visible (or active), when
		using this menu item.
	</para>

			returns that information), other tables that are referenced by the
			currently selected table, any table that references the currently
			selected table and any trigger that is defined on that table.
		</para>

		<para>
			The column list will also display any comments defined for the column
			(if the JDBC driver returns the information).
			Oracle's JDBC driver does not return those comments by default. To enable the
			display of column comments (remarks) you have to supply an <link linkend="profile-extended-properties">extended property</link>
			in your connection profile. The property's name should be <literal>remarksReporting</literal>
			and the value should be set to <literal>true</literal>.
		</para>

		<para>
			If the DBMS supports synonyms, the columns tab will display
			the column definition of the underlying table or view. The source tab
			will display the statement to re-create the synonym. If the underlying object
			of the synonym is a table, then indexes, foreign keys and triggers for

	<section id="table-data">
		<title>Table data</title>
		
		<para>
			The data tab will display the data from the currently selected
			table. There are several options to configure the display of this tab.
			The <literal>Autoload</literal> check box, controls the retrieval of the data. If this is
			checked, then the data will be retrieved from the database as soon as
			the table is selected in the table list (and the tab is visible).
		</para>
    
		<para>
			The data tab will also display a total row count of the table. As this
			display can take a while, the automatic retrieval of the row count can be disabled. 
			To disable the automatic calculation of the table's rowcount, click on the <guibutton>Settings</guibutton> 
			button and deselect the checkbox <literal>Autoload table row count</literal>. To calculate
			the table's row count when this is not done automatically, click on the <literal>Rows</literal>
			label. You can cancel the row count retrieval while it's running by clicking on the label again.
		</para>
    
		<para>
			The data tab is only available if the currently selected objects

			See <link linkend="selectable-objects-setting">selectable object types</link> for details.
		</para>

		<para>
			You can define a maximum number of rows which should be
		retrieved. If you enter 0 (zero) then all rows are retrieved. Limiting
		the number of rows is useful if you have tables with a lot of rows,
		where the entire table would not fit into memory.
		</para>

		<para>In addition to the max rows setting, a second limit can be
		defined. If the total number of rows in the table exceeds this second
		limit, a warning is displayed, whether the data should be loaded.

		<title>Changing the display order of table columns</title>
		<para>
			You can re-arrange the display order of the columns in the data tab using drag &amp; drop.
			If you want to apply that column order whenever you display the table data, you can
			save the column order by right-clicking in the table header and then using the

	<section id="customize-dbexplorer-retrieval">
		<title>Customize data retrieval</title>
		<para>
			When displaying the data for a table, &wb-productname; generates a <literal>SELECT</literal>
			statement that will retrieve all rows and columns from the database. In some cases
			the data for certain data types cannot be displayed correctly as the JDBC drivers might
			not implement a proper "<literal>toString()</literal>" method that converts the data
			into a readable format.
		</para>
		<para>
			You can customize the SELECT statement that is generated by &wb-productname; when retrieving
			table data in the DbExplorer in the configuration file <literal>workbench.settings</literal>.
			For each DBMS you can define an expression for specific data types that are used when
			building the <literal>SELECT</literal> statement.
		</para>
		<para>
			To configure this, you need to add one line per data type and DBMS to the file
			<literal>workbench.settings</literal>:
			<programlisting>workbench.db.[dbid].selectexpression.[type]=expression(${column})</programlisting>
			When building the <literal>SELECT</literal> statement, the placeholder <literal>${column}</literal>
			will be replaced with the actual column name. <literal>[dbid]</literal> is the
			<link linkend="dbid">DBID</link> of the DBMS for which the replacement should be done.
		</para>
		<para>
			The whole key (the part to the left of the equal sign) must be in lowercase.
		</para>
		<para>
			<literal>[type]</literal> is the datatype of the column without any brackets or parameters:
			<literal>varchar</literal> instead of <literal>varchar(10)</literal>, or <literal>number</literal>
			instead of <literal>number(10,2)</literal>
		</para>
		<para>
			To convert e.g. the <literal>geometry</literal> datatype of postgres to a readable format,
			one would use the following expression <literal>astext(transform(geo_column,4326))</literal>.
		</para>
		<para>
			To tell the DbExplorer to replace the retrieval of columns of type <literal>geometry</literal>
			in Postgres with the above expression, the following line in <literal>workbench.settings</literal>
			is necessary:
			<programlisting>workbench.db.postgres.selectexpression.geometry=astext(transform(${column},4326)) </programlisting>
			For e.g. the table <literal>geo_table (id integer, geo_col geometry)</literal> &wb-productname;
			will generate the following <literal>SELECT</literal> statement:
			<programlisting>SELECT id, astext(transform(geo_col,4326))
FROM geo_table
</programlisting>
			to retrieve the data of that table.
		</para>
		
		<note>
			<para>
				Note that the data of columns that have been "converted" through this mechanism, cannot
				be edited any longer.
			</para>
		</note>

		<para>
			Another example is to replace the retrieval of Oracle's <literal>XMLTYPE</literal> datatype.
			To configure the DbExplorer to convert all <literal>XMLTYPE</literal> columns to a string,
			the following line in <literal>workbench.settings</literal> is necessary:
			<programlisting>workbench.db.oracle.selectexpression.xmltype=to_clob(${column})</programlisting>
		</para>
		<para>
			The column name (as displayed in the result set) will usually be the expression that you define
			for the column which might not be convenient in all cases. As all occurances of the
			placeholder (<literal>${column}</literal>) will be replaced you can define an alias for the
			column:
			<programlisting>workbench.db.oracle.selectexpression.xmltype=to_clob(${column}) AS ${column}</programlisting>
		</para>

		<para>
			You can check the generated SELECT statement by using the 
			<link linkend="dbexplorer-select-data">Put SELECT into</link> feature.
			The statement that is generated and put into the editor, is the same as the one used for the
			data retrieval.
		</para>

		<para>
			The defined expression will also be used for the <link linkend="search-tables">Search table data</link> featre.
			If you want to search
			inside the data that is returned by the defined expression you have to make sure that you DBMS
			supports the result of that expression as part of a <literal>LIKE</literal> expression. E.g. for the above
			Oracle example, &wb-productname; will generate the following WHERE condition:
			<programlisting>WHERE to_clob(my_clob_col) LIKE '%searchvalue%'</programlisting>
		</para>
		
		<para>
			&wb-productname; will try to remove an alias from the expression when it is used in
			the <literal>WHERE</literal> clause. To do that, the expression is searched for the occurance
			of the <literal>AS</literal> keyword. Therefor you <emphasis role="bold">have</emphasis> to
			use the <literal>AS</literal> keyword even if your DBMS would allow a column alias without it.

		<para>The data details tab works the same way as the data tab

	<section id="procedure-tab">
		<title>Procedure tab</title>

		<para>
			The procedure tab will list all stored procedures and functions

		</para>
		
		<para>
			To display the procedure's source code &wb-productname; uses its

		</para>
		
	</section>

	<section id="search-tables">
		<title>Search tables</title>

		<para>
			This tab offers the ability to search for a value in all text
			columns of all tables which are selected. The results will be displayed
			on the right side of that tab. The result will always display the
			complete row where the search value was found. Any column that contains
			the entered value will be highlighted.
		</para>

		<para>
			The value will be used to create a <literal>LIKE &apos;value&apos;</literal>
			restriction for each text column on the selected tables. Therefore the
			value should contain a wildcard, otherwise the exact expression will be
			searched.
		</para>

		<para>
			You can apply a function to each column as well. This is useful if
			you want to to do a case insensitive search on Oracle (Oracles VARCHAR
			comparison is case sensitive). In the entry field for the column the
			placeholder $col$ is replaced with the actual column name during the
			search. To do a case insensitive search in Oracle, you would enter
			lower($col$) in the column field and &apos;%test%&apos; in the value
			field.
		</para>

		<para>
			The expression in the column field is sent to the DBMS without
			changes, except the replacement of $col$ with the current column name.
			The above example would yield a <literal>lower(&lt;column_name&gt;) like
			&apos;%test%&apos;</literal> for each text column for the selected tables.
		</para>

		<para>
			The generated SQL statements are logged in the second tab, labeled
			<literal>SQL Statements</literal>.
		</para>

		<para>
			In the resulting tables, &wb-productname; tries to highlight those columns
			which match the criteria. This might not always work, if you apply a function to the
			column itself such as <literal>to_upper()</literal> &wb-productname; does not know
			that this will result in a case-insesitive search on the database. &wb-productname; tries to
			guess if the given function/value combination might result in a case insensitive search (especially
			on a DBMS which does a case sensitive search by default) but this might not work
			in all the cases and for all DBMS.
