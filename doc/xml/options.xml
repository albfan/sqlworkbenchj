    <title>Configuring keyboard shortcuts</title>

    <para>You can configure the keyboard shortcut to execute a specific action (=menu item)
      in the dialog which is displayed when you select <menuchoice><guimenu>Tools</guimenu><guimenu>Configure shortcuts...</guimenu></menuchoice>.
      The dialog lists the available actions together with their configured shortcut and their default shortcut.
    </para>

    <section id="configure-shortcuts-assign">
      <title>Assign a shortcut to an action</title>
      <para>
        To assign a (new) keyboard combination for a specific action, select (highlight) the action in the list
        and click on the <guibutton>Assign</guibutton> button. A small window will pop up, where you can
        press the key combination which you would like to assign to that action.
        Note that only F-Keys (F1, F2, ...) can be used without a modifier (Shift, Control, Alt). All other
        keys need be pressed together with one of the modifier keys.
      </para>
      <para>After you have entered the desired keyboard shortcut, press the <guibutton>OK</guibutton> button.
        If the shortcut is already assigned to a different action, you will be prompted, if you want to
        override that definition. If you select to overwrite the shortcut for the other action, that
        action will then have <emphasis role="bold">no</emphasis> shortcut assigned
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="configure-shortcuts-clear">
      <title>Removing a shortcut from an action</title>
      <para>
          To remove a shortcut completely from an action, select (highlight) that action, and
          click on the <guibutton>Clear</guibutton> button. Once the shortcut has been cleared,
          the action is no longer accessible through a shortcut (only through the menu).
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="configure-shortcuts-reset">
      <title>Reset to defaults</title>
      <para>
          If you want to reset the shortcut for a single action to its default, select (highlight) the
          action in the list, and click on the <guibutton>Reset</guibutton> button.
          To reset all shortcuts click on the <guibutton>Reset all</guibutton> button.

  <section id="options-explorer-as-tab">
    <title>DB Explorer as Tab</title>

    <para>The Database Explorer can either be displayed as a separate
      window, or inside the main window as a another tab. If this option is
      selected, the Db Explorer will be displayed inside the main window. If
      the option Retrieve DB Explorer is checked as well, the current database
      scheme will be retrieved upon starting &wb-productname;</para>
  </section>

  <section id="options-retrieve-explorer" xreflabel="Retrieve DB Explorer">
    <title>Retrieve DB Explorer</title>

    <para>If this option is enabled, the contents of the database schema is
      retrieved when the DB Explorer is displayed. If this option is not
      checked, either the <guibutton>Refresh</guibutton> button or selecting a schema or
      table type will load the list.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="options-encrypt-password">
    <title>Encrypt passwords</title>

    <para>If this option is enabled, the password stored within a connection
      profile will be encrypted. Whether the password should be stored at all
      can be selected in the profile itself.</para>
			<note>Using this option only supplies very limited security. As the 
			source code for &wb-productname; is freely available, the algorithm 
			to decrypt the passwords stored in this way can easily be extracted
			to retrieve the plain text passwords.</note>
  </section>

  <section id="options-confirm-update">
    <title>Confirm result set updates</title>

    <para>When this option is enabled, the statements which are sent to the
      database when saving changes to result set table, are displayed before
      execution. The update can be cancelled at that point if the statements
      are not correct. The generated statements can also be saved to a file
      from that window.</para>

    <para>The displayed statements can not be changed!</para>
  </section>

  <section id="options-consolidate-log">
    <title>Consolidate script log</title>

    <para>Usually &wb-productname; reports the success and timings
        for each statement that is beeing executed in the message tab
        of the current SQL panel. For large scripts this can slow down
        script execution dramatically. If this option is enabled, only
        a summary of the execution is printed once the script has finished.
        You can turn off the log during script execution by using
        the <link linkend="command-wbfeedback">WBFEEDBACK</link> command.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section id="options-enable-out" xreflabel="Enabling DBMS_OUTPUT">
    <title>Enable DBMS_OUTPUT</title>

    <para>If this option is enabled, the <literal>DBMS_OUTPUT</literal> package is
      automatically enabled when connecting to an Oracle database. This option
      has no effect on other DBMS. If it is disabled, the <literal>DBMS_OUTPUT</literal> package
      can be enabled using the <xref linkend="command-enableout"/> command.</para>

    <para>If this option is not checked, you need to manually enable the <literal>DBMS_OUTPUT</literal>
      with <xref linkend="command-enableout"/>.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="option-animated-icon" xreflabel="Enable animated icons">
    <title>Enable animated icons</title>
    <para>Enable or disable the use of an animated icons in the SQL editor to
      indicate a running SQL statement. It has been reported, that the animated
      icon does have a severe (negativ) impact on the performance on some computers
      (depending on JDK/OS/Graphics driver).
      If you experience a high CPU usage during the execution of SQL statements, or
      if you find your SQL statements are running very slow, try
      to turn off the usage of the animated icons.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="options-date-format">
    <title>Date and Date/time format</title>

    <para>Define the format for displaying date and date/time (timestamp) columns in the result
      set. For details on the format of this option, please refer to the 
    documentation of the <ulink url="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html"><literal>SimpleDateFormat</literal></ulink> class.
		This format is also used when parsing input for date or timestamp fields, so if you 
		enter a date, make sure you enter it the same way as defined with this option.
    </para>
		<para>
			Here is an overview of the letters and their meaning that can be used to format
			the date and timestamp values. Be aware that case matters!

  <section id="options-alternate-delimiter" xreflabel="alternate delimiter">
    <title>Alternate Delimiter</title>

    <para>When last characters of the text in the editor match the character
      sequence in this input field, this character sequence is used to delimit
      individual statements in the editor.</para>

    <para>This is needed when creating stored procedures which themselves
      have a semicolon in the source code. Normally the &wb-productname; would
      stop parsing the command at the first semicolon and send that command to
      the database (which will produce an error message as the statement is
      not complete).</para>

    <para>In the case of a <literal>CREATE PROCEDURE</literal> statement this should be
      terminated with the character sequence entered in this input field. The
      terminator can have more than one character e.g. ./
      (a dot followed by a slash).
      It should not be a sequence which is used inside a SQL statement.</para>

    <para>Using a slash as the terminator (as e.g. SQL*Plus does) might lead
      to problems when stored procedures are created that do calculations such
      as</para>

    <para><programlisting>SELECT sum(field)/count(*) FROM table;</programlisting></para>

    <para>This would lead to problems as the slash is recognized as the
      statement terminator. Thus the &wb-productname; would send everything up
      to sum(field) to the database and execute it. The same is true when
      using the column mapping parameters for the <link linkend="command-copy"><literal>WBCOPY</literal></link>
      command.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="options-history-size">
    <title>History size</title>

    <para>The number of statements per tab which should be stored in the
      statement history. Remember that always the full text of the editor
      (together with the selection and cursor information) is stored in the
      history. If you have large amounts of text in the editor and set this
      number quite high, be aware of the memory consumption this might create.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="options-decimal-symbol">
    <title>Decimal symbol</title>

    <para>The character which is used as the decimal separator when
      displaying numbers.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="options-decimal-digits">
    <title>Decimal digits</title>

    <para>Define the maximum number of digits which will be displayed for
      numeric columns. This only affects the display of the number internally
      they are still stored as the DBMS returned them. To see the internal
      value, leave the mouse cursor over the cell. The tooltip which is
      displayed will contain the number as it was returned by the JDBC driver.
      When exporting data or copying it to the clipboard, the real value will
      be used.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="options-column-width">
    <title>Max column width</title>

    <para>When the initial display size of a column is calculated, the
      column width will not exceed this number. This is useful when displaying
      large character columns.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="options-filed-delimiter">
    <title>Field delimiter</title>

    <para>The default delimiter used when exporting data to a text file.
      This can be overridden in the file selection dialog when actually
      exporting the data.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="options-quote-character">
    <title>Quote character</title>

    <para>This character will be used to quote column data when exporting to
      a text file. When using a tab character (\t) as the field delimiter this
      is not really necessary. When using a comma as the field delimiter,
      quoting the data is necessary in case the data contains a a comma (or
      whatever character is used to delimit the columns). This will be the
      default for exporting data through the menu. If you use the <link
    linkend="command-export"><literal>SPOOL</literal> command</link>, you can
      freely customize the output for each file you create.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="options-deftabletype">
    <title>Default Object Type</title>
    <para>This setting allows you to control the initial display of objects in the
    <link linkend="dbexplorer">DbExplorer's</link> table panel. The value entered here
      will be used to set the default selection in the type drop down.</para>
    <para>The list in that dropdown is retrieved from the underlying DBMS through
      a JDBC function call. So the value entered here should be something that is
      available on all used DBMS. If the value entered in this property is not found
      in the list, the selection defaults to "*" which means all object types.</para>
    <note>
      <para>Don't forget to enable <xref linkend="options-retrieve-explorer"/> so
      that the DbExplorer will be retrieved automatically with the desired object
      type, when you open it.</para>
