      <title>DB Explorer as Tab</title>

      <para>The Database Explorer can either be displayed as a separate
      window, or inside the main window as a another tab. If this option is
      selected, the Db Explorer will be displayed inside the main window. If

      to turn off the usage of the animated icons.</para>

    </section>

    <section id="options-alternate-delimiter" xreflabel="alternate delimiter">
      <title>Alternate Delimiter</title>

      <para>When last characters of the text in the editor match the character
      sequence in this input field, this character sequence is used to delimit
      individual statements in the editor.</para>

      <para>This is needed when creating stored procedures which themselves
      have a semicolon in the source code. Normally the &wb-productname; would
      stop parsing the command at the first semicolon and send that command to
      the database (which will produce an error message as the statement is
      not complete).</para>

      <para>In the case of a <literal>CREATE PROCEDURE</literal> statement this should be
      terminated with the character sequence entered in this input field. The
      terminator can have more than one character e.g. ./
      (a dot followed by a slash).
      It should not be a sequence which is used inside a SQL statement.</para>

      <para>Using a slash as the terminator (as e.g. SQL*Plus does) might lead
      to problems when stored procedures are created that do calculations such
      as</para>

      <para><programlisting>SELECT sum(field)/count(*) FROM table;</programlisting></para>

      <para>This would lead to problems as the slash is recognized as the
      statement terminator. Thus the &wb-productname; would send everything up
      to sum(field) to the database and execute it.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="options-history-size">
      <title>History size</title>

      <para>The number of statements per tab which should be stored in the
      statement history. Remember that always the full text of the editor
      (together with the selection and cursor information) is stored in the
      history. If you have large amounts of text in the editor and set this
      number quite high, be aware of the memory consumption this might create.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="options-decimal-symbol">
      <title>Decimal symbol</title>

      <para>The character which is used as the decimal separator when
      displaying numbers.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="options-decimal-digits">
      <title>Decimal digits</title>

      <para>Define the maximum number of digits which will be displayed for
      numeric columns. This only affects the display of the number internally
      they are still stored as the DBMS returned them. To see the internal
      value, leave the mouse cursor over the cell. The tooltip which is
      displayed will contain the number as it was returned by the JDBC driver.
      When exporting data or copying it to the clipboard, the real value will
      be used.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="options-column-width">
      <title>Max column width</title>

      <para>When the initial display size of a column is calculated, the

      large character columns.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="options-filed-delimiter">
      <title>Field delimiter</title>

      <para>The default delimiter used when exporting data to a text file.
      This can be overridden in the file selection dialog when actually
      exporting the data.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="options-quote-character">
      <title>Quote character</title>

      <para>This character will be used to quote column data when exporting to
      a text file. When using a tab character (\t) as the field delimiter this
      is not really necessary. When using a comma as the field delimiter,
      quoting the data is necessary in case the data contains a a comma (or
      whatever character is used to delimit the columns). This will be the
      default for exporting data through the menu. If you use the <link
      linkend="command-spool"><literal>SPOOL</literal> command</link>, you can
      freely customize the output for each file you create.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="options-deftabletype">
    <title>Default Object Type</title>
      <para>This setting allows you to control the initial display of objects in the
      <link linkend="dbexplorer">DbExplorer's</link> table panel. The value entered here
      will be used to set the default selection in the type drop down.</para>
      <para>The list in that dropdown is retrieved from the underlying DBMS through
      a JDBC function call. So the value entered here should be something that is
      available on all used DBMS. If the value entered in this property is not found
      in the list, the selection defaults to "*" which means all object types.</para>
      <note>
      <para>Don't forget to enable <xref linkend="options-retrieve-explorer"/> so
      that the DbExplorer will be retrieved automatically with the desired object
      type, when you open it.</para>

                <entry><para>For a DBMS identifier you can define a list of commands
                that are simply ignored by &wb-productname;. This is useful e.g. for Oracle, 
                when you want to run scripts that are intended for SQL*Plus. If those scripts
                contain special SQL*Plus commands (that are not understood by the Oracle server
                as SQL*Plus executes these commands directly) they would fail in &wb-productname;.
                If those commands are simply ignored and not send to the server, the scripts
                can run without modification.</para>
