		<para>
			On this page, you can define external tools (programs). Currently the only
			place where this is used, is in the <link linkend="update-blob-editmode">blob info dialog</link>, 
			to open the BLOB data with one of the defined external tools. This could 
			be a program to display images (like <ulink url="http://www.xnview.org">XnView</ulink>), 
			<ulink url="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/index.html">Acrobat Reader</ulink> 
			to display PDF documents, <ulink url="http://www.openoffice.org">OpenOffice</ulink> to display 
			office documents or a text editor (like <ulink url="http://www.pspad.com">PSPad</ulink>) to 
			display text files.

		<title>Look and Feel</title>		
		<para>
			If you want to use additional Look and Feels that are not part 
			of the JDK, you can specify them here.  
		</para>
		<para>
			A Look And Feel definition consists of a name, the class name to be used and 
			the location of the JAR file that provides the look and feel implementation.
			The class name that has to be used should be available in the documentation
			of the look and feel of your choice. The name is &wb-productname; internal
			and is only used when displaying the list of available Look and Feels. 
		</para>
		<para>
			When you switch the current Look &amp; Feel, you will need to restart the 
			application to activate the new look and feel. Note that if you switch
			the current Look &amp; Feel it will be changed, regardless whether
			you close the options dialog using Cancel or OK.
		</para>
		<note><para>
			The current look and feel is only changed when you click on the 
			<guibutton>Make current</guibutton> button. Simply selecting a different entry
			in the list on the left side will <emphasis role="bold">not</emphasis> 
			change the look and feel.
