	<title>Using &wb-productname; specific annotations in SQL comments</title>
  <para>
    By adding special comments to a SQL (select) statement, you can influence the way the result is displayed in &wb-productname;.
    This comments are called "annotations" and must be included in a comment preceding the statement that is executed.
    The comment can be a single line or multi-line SQL comment

			<title>Naming result tabs</title>
			<para>
				You can change the name of the result tab associated with a statement. To give a result
				set a name, use the annotation <literal>@WbResult</literal> followed by the name that should
				appear as the result's name.
			</para>
			<para>
				The following examples executes two statements. The result for the first will be labelled
				"List of contacts" and the second will be labelled "List of companies":

SELECT * FROM person;

/*
 @WbResult List of companies
 this will retrieve all companies from the database
*/
SELECT * FROM company;</programlisting>
			<para>
				The result name that is used, will be everything after the annotation's keyword until the end of the line.
			</para>
			<para>
				For the second select (with the multi-line comment), the name of the result tab will be
				<literal>List of companies</literal>, the comment on the second line will not be considered.

    <section id="result-tab-reuse">
      <title>Re-using an existing named result tab</title>
      <para>
        If the result of a query should be displayed in an existing result tab, the annotation <literal>@WbUseTab</literal>
        together with a tab name can be used. If this annotation is present and a result tab with that name already
        exists, the existing result will be replaced with the new result. If no result tab with that name exists,
        a new tab (with the supplied name) will be created.
      </para>
      <para>
        <note>
          Re-using a result tab only works if <menuchoice><guimenu>SQL</guimenu><guimenuitem>Append new results</guimenuitem></menuchoice> is enabled.
          You can combine <literal>@WbUseTab</literal> with the <literal>@WbAppendResult</literal> annotation to
          force re-using an existing result even though the option is turned off.
        </note>
      </para>
      <para>
        If the following query is run for the second time, the existing data will be replaced with the
        newly retrieved data:
      </para>
    <programlisting>-- @WbUseTab List of contacts
SELECT * FROM person;
</programlisting>
    </section>

    <section id="scroll-annotation">
      <title>Scrolling the result</title>
      <para>
        The annotation <literal>@WbScrollTo</literal> can be used to automatically scroll a result set after it has been retrieved
        to a specific row number. The row number has to be supplied using a <literal>#</literal> sign:
      </para>
    <programlisting>-- @WbScrollTo #100
SELECT *
FROM person;
</programlisting>

      <para>
        In addition to a row number, the special values <literal>end</literal> or <literal>last</literal> (without a <literal>#</literal>)
        are also recognized. When they are supplied, the result is automatically scrolled to the last row.
        This is useful when displaying the contents of log tables.
      </para>

    <programlisting>-- @WbScrollTo end
SELECT *
FROM activity_log;
</programlisting>

    </section>

    <section id="append-annotation">
      <title>Appending a results</title>
      <para>
        The annotation <literal>@WbAppendResult</literal> can be used to always append the result of the associated query regardless of
        the current setting of <menuchoice><guimenu>SQL</guimenu><guimenuitem>Append new results</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="remove-empty-annotation">
      <title>Suppressing empty results</title>
      <para>
        To suppress an empty result, the annotation <literal>@WbRemoveEmpty</literal> can be used. If a query
        returns no rows and contains this annotation, no result tab will be created. No warning or message will
        be shown if this happens!
