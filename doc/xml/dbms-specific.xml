       <title>Checking for un-committed changes</title>
       <para>
         Before a SQL panel (or the application) is closed, &wb-productname; will check if the current connection
         has any un-committed changes (e.g. an <literal>INSERT</literal> without a <literal>COMMIT</literal>).
         This is done by checking the <ulink url="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/view-pg-locks.html"><literal>pg_locks</literal></ulink>
         system view. The information in this view might not always be 100% correct and can report open transactions even though
         there are none.
       </para>
       <para>
         The checking for un-committed changes can be controlled through the <link linkend="profile-open-trans">connection profile</link>.

       <para>

         has any un-committed changes (e.g. an <literal>INSERT</literal> without a <literal>COMMIT</literal>).

         system view.

       <title>SQL*Plus autotrace mode</title>

       <para>
         &wb-productname; supports the a mode similar to <ulink url="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/server.112/e16604/ch_twelve040.htm#i2698680">"autotrace"</ulink> mode in SQL*Plus.
         The command to turn on autotrace is the same as in SQL*Plus and supports the same options.
         For details see the description of the <link linkend="command-set-autotrace">SET</link> command.
       </para>
       <para>
         The current user needs to have the <ulink url="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/server.112/e16604/ch_eight.htm#i1037226"><literal>PLUSTRACE</literal></ulink>
         role in order to be able to see statement statistics (which is required by SQL*Plus as well).
         The <literal>PLUSTRACE</literal> role grants the <literal>SELECT</literal>
         privilege on the system views: <literal>V$SESSTAT</literal>, <literal>V$STATNAME</literal> and <literal>V$MYSTAT</literal>. The role
         is not required for the <literal>traceonly explain</literal> option.
       </para>

       <para>
         As an extension to the Oracle syntax, &wb-productname; supports the keyword <literal>realplan</literal> as a
         substiture for <literal>explain</literal>. In that case the execution plan is also displayed but not by
         using <literal>EXPLAIN PLAN</literal> but by retrieving the actual execution plan that is available
         via <literal>dbms_xplan.display_cursor()</literal>. In order to use that package, the execute SQL
         will be changed by &wb-productname;. It will prepend it with a unique identifier so that the SQL can be
         found again in Oracle's system views and it will add the <literal>gather_plan_statistics</literal> hint
         to the statement in order to get more detailed statistics in the execution plan.
       </para>
       <para>
         In order to see the "real" execution plan, use <literal>set autotrace traceonly realplan</literal> instead
         of <literal>set autotrace traceonly explain</literal>.
       </para>
