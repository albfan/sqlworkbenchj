  <title>Comparing databases</title>

  <para>
    There are two &wb-productname; specific commands that can compare either the structure of two databases or
    the data contained in them.
  </para>

	<para>
		These commands (<literal>WbSchemaDiff</literal> and <literal>WbDataDiff</literal>) can be used like
    any other SQL command as long as they are run using &wb-productname; This includes the usage in scripts
    that are run in <link linkend="using-scripting">batch mode</link>.

  <section id="command-schema-diff">
    <title>Compare two database schemas - WbSchemaDiff</title>

    <para>
      <literal>WbSchemaDiff</literal> analyzes two schemas (or a list of tables)
      and outputs the differences between those schemas as an XML file. The XML file
      describes the changes that need to be applied to the target schema to have
      the same structure as the reference schema, e.g. modify column definitions,
      remove or add tables, remove or add indexes.
    </para>

    <para>
      The output is intended to be transformed using XSLT (e.g. with the
      <link linkend="command-xslt">WbXSLT Command</link>).

      Sample XSLT transformations are stored in the <literal>xslt</literal> subdirectory of the &wb-productname; installation
      directory. All scripts that are part of the download can also be found on the
      <ulink url="http://www.sql-workbench.net/xslt.html">&wb-productname; homepage</ulink>
    </para>

    <note>
    <para>
      This feature should only be considered as a one-off solution to quickly compare to database schemas. Is not intended
      to replace a proper schema (script) management. You should consider tools like <ulink url="http://liquibase.org/">Liquibase</ulink>
      or <ulink url="http://flywaydb.org/">Flyway</ulink> to manage a database schema.
      Those scripts should also be stored in a version control system (Subversion, GIT, ...)

    <title>Compare data across databases - WbDataDiff</title>

    <para>
      The <literal>WbDataDiff</literal> command can be used to generate SQL scripts
      that update a target database such that the data is identical to a reference
      database. This is similar to the <literal>WbSchemaDiff</literal> but compares
      the actual data in the tables rather than the table structure.
    </para>
    <para>
      For each table the command will create up to three script files, depending on
      the needed statements to migrate the data. One file for <literal>UPDATE</literal> statements,
      one file for <literal>INSERT</literal> statements and one file for <literal>DELETE</literal>
      statements (if <literal>-includeDelete=true</literal> is specified)
    </para>

    <note><para>
      As this command needs to read every row from the reference and the target
      table, processing large tables can take quite some time, especially if <literal>DELETE</literal>
      statements should also be generated.
    </para></note>

    <para>
      <literal>WbDataDiff</literal> requires that all involved tables have a primary key
      defined. If a table does not have a primary key, <literal>WbDataDiff</literal> will
      stop the processing.
    </para>

    <para>
      To improve performance (a bit), the rows are retrieved in chunks from the
      target table by dynamically constructing a WHERE clause for the rows
      that were retrieved from the reference table. The chunk size
      can be controlled using the property <literal>workbench.sql.sync.chunksize</literal>
      The chunk size defaults to 25. This is a conservative setting to avoid
      problems with long SQL statements when processing tables that have
      a PK with multiple columns. If you know that your primary keys
      consist only of a single column and the values won't be too long, you
      can increase the chunk size, possibly increasing the performace when
      generating the SQL statements. As most DBMS have a limit on the length
      of a single SQL statement, be careful when setting the chunksize too high.
      The same chunk size is applied when generating <literal>DELETE</literal>
      statements by the <link linkend="command-copy"><literal>WbCopy</literal></link> command,
      when <link linkend="copy-sync-delete">syncDelete</link> mode is enabled.

          <entry id="data-diff-fname">-file</entry>
          <entry>
            The filename of the main script file. The command creates two
            scripts per table. One script named <literal>update_&lt;tablename&gt;.sql</literal>
            that contains all needed <literal>UPDATE</literal> or <literal>INSERT</literal>
            statements. The second script is named <literal>delete_&lt;tablename&gt;.sql</literal>
            and will contain all <literal>DELETE</literal> statements for the target table.
            The main script merely calls (using <link linkend="command-wbinclude">WbInclude</link>)
            the generated scripts for each table.
            You can enable writing a single file that includes all statements for all tables by using the parameter

        </row>

        <row>
          <entry id="data-diff-reftables">-referenceTables</entry>
          <entry>
            A (comma separated) list of tables that are the reference
            tables, to be checked. You can specify the table with wildcards,
            e.g. <literal>-referenceTables=P%</literal> to compare all tables

            <para>
              A (comma separated) list of tables in the target
              connection to be compared to the source tables. The tables
              are "matched" by their position in the list. The first table in the
              <literal>-referenceTables</literal> parameter is compared to the
              first table in the <literal>-targetTables</literal> parameter, and so
              on. Using this parameter you can compare tables that do not have the
              same name.
            </para>
            <para>
              If you omit this parameter, then all tables from the
              target connection with the same names as those listed in
              <literal>-referenceTables</literal> are compared.
            </para>
            <para>
              If you omit both parameters, then all tables that the
              user can access are retrieved from the source connection
              and compared to the tables with the same name in the target
              connection.

            A comma separated list of tables that should not be compared. If tables from
            several schemas are compared (using <literal>-referenceTables=schema_one.*, schema_two.*</literal>) then
            the listed tables must be qualified with a schema, e.g. <literal>-excludeTables=schema_one.foobar, schema_two.fubar</literal>

              in the target table, but not in the reference table. Note that enabling this
              option will result in additional overhead reading the target table's data and
              will slow down the overal comparison speed.

            <para>
              With this parameter you can define a list of column names that should not be considered when comparing
              data. You can e.g. exclude columns that store the last access time of a row, or the last update time if
              that should not be taken into account when checking for changes.
            </para>
            <para>
              They will however be part of generated <literal>INSERT</literal> or <literal>UPDATE</literal> statements

          <entry>
            <para>
              With this parameter alternate keys can be defined for the tables that are compared. The parameter
              can be repeated multiple times to set the keys for multiple tables in the following format:
              <literal>-alternateKey='table_1=column_1,column_2'</literal>
            </para>
            <para>
              Note that each value has to be enclosed in either single or double quotes to mask the equals sign
              embedded in the parameter value.
            </para>
            <para>
              Once an alternate (primary) key has been defined, the primary key columns defined on the tables
              are ignored. By default the real PK columns will however be included in <literal>INSERT</literal> statement that are generated.
              To avoid this, set the parameter <literal>-excludeRealPK</literal> to true.

          <entry>
            <para>Valid values are <literal>true</literal>, <literal>false</literal>.</para>
            <para>
              This parameter controls the usage of the real PK columns in case alternate PK columns are defined.
              If set to <literal>true</literal> the real PK columns are excluded from generated <literal>INSERT</literal>
              statements (assuming that a new PK value will be generated during inserting the rows).
            </para>
            <para>
              Note that this parameter will enable/disable the use of the real PK columns for <emphasis role="bold">all</emphasis>
              tables for which alternate key columns were defined.
            </para>
            <para>
              This parameter has no effect if no alternate keys were specified using the <literal>-alternateKey</literal> option.
