    <para>
      To run &wb-productname; a <ulink url="http://www.java.com/">Java 8 runtime environment</ulink>
      or higher is required. You can either use a JRE ("Runtime") or a JDK ("Development Kit") to run &wb-productname;.
    </para>

    <para>
      &wb-productname; does not need a "fully installed" runtime environment, you can also copy
      the <literal>jre</literal> directory from an existing Java installation or use the no-installer
      packages from the Oracle home page
    </para>

    <para>
      The "local" Java installation in the <literal>jre</literal> subdirectory will <emphasis role="bold">not</emphasis>
      be used by the Windows&reg; launcher if a Java runtime has been installed and <emphasis>is registered</emphasis>
      in the system (i.e. the Windows&reg; registry)
    </para>

    <para>
      If you cannot (or do not want to) do a regular installation of a Java 8 runtime, you can download
      a ZIP distribution from <ulink url="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Oracle's home page</ulink>
      Under <ulink url="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html">"JRE Download"</ulink>
      you can download <literal>tar.gz</literal> archives for Windows&reg; and Linux (32bit and 64bit versions are available).
    </para>
    <para>
      The archive just needs to be unpacked. Inside the archive the actual JRE is stored in a directory named e.g.
      <literal>jre1.8.0_xx</literal> where <literal>xx</literal> is the build number of the Java runtime.
      When moving this directory to the installation directory of &wb-productname; you have to rename it to <literal>jre</literal>
      in order for the Windows&reg; launcher or the batch files to recognize it.
    </para>

      Once you have downloaded the application's distribution package, unzip the archive into a directory
      of your choice. Apart from that, no special installation procedure is needed.
    </para>

    <para>
      You will need to configure the necessary JDBC driver(s) for your database before you
      can connect to a database. Please refer to the chapter <link linkend="jdbc-setup">JDBC Drivers</link>
      for details on how to make the JDBC driver available to &wb-productname;
    </para>

    <para>
      When starting &wb-productname; for the first time, it will create a directory
      called <literal>.sqlworkbench</literal> in the current user's home folder to
      store all its configuration information.
    </para>

    <para>
      The "user's home directory" is <literal>$HOME</literal> on a Linux or Unix based system,
      and <literal>%HOMEPATH%</literal> on a Windows&reg; system. (Technically speaking
      it is using the contents of Java system property <literal>user.home</literal> to
      find the user's home directory)

      When upgrading to a newer version of &wb-productname; simply overwrite the old
      <literal>sqlworkbench.jar</literal>, the <literal>exe</literal> files and shell scripts that
      start the application. If you are using the bundle that includes the libraries for
      reading and writing OpenOffice and Microsoft Office files, replace all existing <literal>jar</literal> files
      with those from the distribution archive as well.

      sqlworkbench.jar is a self executing JAR file. This means, that if
      your Java runtime is installed and registered with the system, a double click
      on <literal>sqlworkbench.jar</literal> will execute the application. To run the application
      manually use the command:
    </para>

    <programlisting>java -jar sqlworkbench.jar</programlisting>

    <para>
      Native executables for Windows&reg; and Mac OSX are supplied that start &wb-productname; by
      using the default Java runtime installed on your system. Details on using
      the <link linkend="launcher-using">Windows&reg; launcher</link> can be found

    <title>Starting the program using the shell script</title>
    <para>
      To run &wb-productname; under an Unix-type operating system, the supplied shell script

      file is available.
    </para>

    <section id="jdk-shell">
      <title>Specifying the Java runtime for the shell script</title>

      <para>
        The shell scripts (and the batch files) first check if a Java runtime is available in the sub-directory <literal>jre</literal>.
        If that is available it will be used.
      </para>
      <para>
        If no "local" Java runtime is found, the environment variable <literal>WORKBENCH_JDK</literal>
        is checked. If that variable is defined and points to a Java runtime installation, the shell script will
        use <literal>$WORKBENCH_JDK/bin/java</literal> to run the application.
      </para>
      <para>
        If <literal>WORKBENCH_JDK</literal> is not defined, the shell script will check
        for the environment variable <literal>JAVA_HOME</literal>. If that is defined, the script
        will use <literal>$JAVA_HOME/bin/java</literal> to run the application.
      </para>
      <para>
        If neither <literal>WORKBENCH_JDK</literal> nor <literal>JAVA_HOME</literal> is defined,
        the shell script will simply use <literal>java</literal> to start the application,
        assuming that a valid Java runtime is available on the path.
      </para>
      <para>
        All parameters that are passed to the shell scripts are passed to the application, not to the
        Java runtime. If you want to change the memory or other system settings for the JVM, you need to
        edit the shell script.

      &wb-productname; does not need a "fully installed" runtime environment, you can also copy
      the <literal>jre</literal> directory from an existing Java installation.

      Under <ulink url="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html">"JRE Download"</ulink> there is also
      an option to download a no-installer version. These downloads are offered as <literal>tar.gz</literal> archives, so a tool
      that can handle Unix/Linux that format is needed for unpacking the archive (e.g.

    </para>

    <para>
      By default, the memory available to &wb-productname; is determined by the Java runtime.
      If you need more heap memory (e.g. because you have to load large result sets), you need to pass the appropriate JVM parameter to the launcher.
      Please refer to <link linkend="install-increase-memory">Increasing the memory</link> for details

      </para>
      <para>
        If the launcher cannot find your installed Java runtime, you can specify the location of the JRE by creating a text file

      <programlisting>vm.location=c:\Program Files\Java\jdk8\jre\bin\client\jvm.dll</programlisting>
      <para>
        You need to specify the <emphasis role="bold">full path</emphasis> to the <literal>jvm.dll</literal>,
        not the directory where the Java runtime is installed. Note that the 64bit JRE does not have the <literal>client</literal>

    </para>

    <para>
      If no configuration directory has been specified on the commandline,
      &wb-productname; will identify the configuration directory by looking at the following places

      If no configuration directory can be identified, it will be created in the user's home directory (as <literal>.sqlworkbench</literal>).
    </para>

      The above mentioned search can be overridden by supplying the configuration directory
      <link linkend="cmdline-parameter-configdir">on the commandline</link> when starting the application.

  <section id="move-installation">
    <title>Copying an installation</title>

    <para>
      To copy an installation to a different computer, simply copy all the files from the configuration directory
      to the other computer (the log file does not need to be copied).
      When a profile is connected to a workspace, the workspace file should be specified
      without a directory name (or using the <literal>%ConfigDir%</literal> placeholder).
      In that case it is always loaded from the configuration directory.
      If the workspace file is given with an absolute directory, this needs to be adjusted
      after the copying the files.

    <para>
      You will need to edit the driver definitions (stored in <filename>WbDrivers.xml</filename>)
      because the <emphasis>full path</emphasis> to the driver's jar file(s) is stored in the file.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you store all JDBC drivers in a common directory (or below a common root directory)
      you can define the <link linkend="settings-libdir">libdir variable</link>. In that case the paths to the

  <section id="install-increase-memory">
    <title>Increasing the memory available to the application</title>
    <para>
      &wb-productname; is a Java application and thus runs inside a virtual machine (JVM).
      The virtual machine limits the memory of the application independently from the installed
      memory that is available to the operating system.
    </para>

    <para>
      &wb-productname; reads <emphasis role="bold">all</emphasis> the data that is
      returned by a SQL statement into memory. When retrieving large result sets, you might
      get an error message, indicating that not enough memory is available. In this
      case you need to increase the memory that the JVM requests from the operating
      system (or change your statement to return fewer rows).
    </para>

    <para>
      When using a 32bit Java runtime the default maximum memory is set to 1GB. When using a 64bit Java runtime
      the default is set to 50% of the available physical memory.
    </para>

    <para>
      To increase the memory that is available to the application, you can pass the parameter <literal>-Xmx</literal>
      to the Windows&reg; launcher, specifying the maximum memory the application is allowed to use. To increase the memory
      to 1.4GB, you can use: <literal>-Xmx1400m</literal>. This can e.g. be added to the shortcut you use to
      start &wb-productname;
    </para>

    <para>
      <note>
        With a 32bit Java runtime, you can't assign more than approx. 1.5GB for the application. If you really need
        to process results that require that much memory you will have to use a 64bit Java runtime.
      </note>
    </para>

   <para>
      If you are running &wb-productname; on a non-Windows&reg; operating system or do not
      want to use the launcher, then you need to pass this parameter directly to the JVM.
      If you are running a 64bit Java runtime you can increase the memory to 2GB using
      the following command line:
    </para>
    <para><programlisting>java -Xmx2048m -jar sqlworkbench.jar</programlisting></para>

    <para>
      If you are using the supplied shell scripts to start &wb-productname;, you can
      edit the scripts and change the value for the -Xmx parameter in there.
