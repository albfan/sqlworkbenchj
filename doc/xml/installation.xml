      To run &wb-productname; a <ulink url="http://www.java.com/">Java 7 runtime environment</ulink>
      or higher is required. You can either use a JRE ("Runtime") or a JDK ("Development Kit") to run &wb-productname;.
    </para>
    <para>
      A Java 6 runtime will work as well, but because Java 6 is no longer supported it is not recommended to use it.

    <para>
      &wb-productname; does not need a "fully installed" runtime environment, you can also copy
      the <literal>jre</literal> directory from an existing Java installation or use the no-installer
      packages from the Oracle homepage

      The "local" Java installation in the <literal>jre</literal> subdirectory will <emphasis role="bold">not</emphasis>

      If you cannot (or do not want to) do a regular installation of a Java 7 runtime, you can download
      a ZIP distribution from <ulink url="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Oracle's homepage</ulink>
      Under <ulink url="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre7-downloads-1880261.html">"JRE Download"</ulink>
      you can download <literal>tar.gz</literal> archives for Windows&reg; and Linux (32bit and 64bit versions are available).
    </para>
    <para>
      The archive just needs to be unpacked. Inside the archive the actual JRE is stored in a directory named e.g.
      <literal>jre1.7.0_xx</literal> where <literal>xx</literal> is the build number of the Java runtime.
      When moving this directory to the installation directory of &wb-productname; you have to rename it to <literal>jre</literal>
      in order for the Windows&reg; launcher or the batch files to recognize it.

      You will need to configure the necessary JDBC driver(s) for your database before you

      <para>
        If no "local" Java runtime is found, the environment variable <literal>WORKBENCH_JDK</literal>

      <para>
        If neither <literal>WORKBENCH_JDK</literal> nor <literal>JAVA_HOME</literal> is defined,

      &wb-productname; reads <emphasis role="bold">all</emphasis> the data that is

      <para>
        In this case the file <literal>WbProfiles.xml</literal> must be in the current
        (working) directory of the application. If this is not the case, please specify the
        location of the profile using either the <link linkend="cmdline-parameter-profilestorage"><literal>-profilestorage</literal></link> or
        <link linkend="cmdline-parameter-configdir"><literal>-configDir</literal></link> parameter.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you have two profiles with the names <literal>&quot;Oracle - Test&quot;</literal> you will
        need to specify the profile group as well (in one line):
      </para>
      <programlisting>java -jar sqlworkbench.jar
     -profile='PostgreSQL - Test'
     -profilegroup='Local'
     -script='test.sql'</programlisting>
    </section>

    <section id="commandline-connect-noprofile">
      <title>Connect without a profile</title>
      <indexterm><primary>Command line</primary><secondary>JDBC connection</secondary></indexterm>

      <para>
        You can also specify the full connection parameters on the commandline, if
        you don&apos;t want to create a profile only for executing a batch file.
        The advantage of this method is, that &wb-productname; does not need the files
        <filename>WbProfiles.xml</filename>, <filename>WbDrivers.xml</filename> to be
        able to connect to the database.
      </para>

      <para>The connection can be specified with the following parameters:</para>

            <row>
              <entry>-emptyStringIsNull</entry>
              <entry>This parameter corresponds to the
              <link linkend="profile-empty-string-is-null">Empty String is NULL</link>
              setting of the connection profile. This will only be needed when editing a result set in GUI mode.
              </entry>
            </row>

            <row>
              <entry>-connectionProperties</entry>
              <entry>
                <para>
                  This parameter can be used to pass <link linkend="profile-extended-properties">extended connection properties</link> if
                  the driver does not support them e.g. in the JDBC URL. The values are passed as key=value pairs,
                  e.g. <literal>-connectionProperties=someProp=42</literal>
                </para>
                <para>
                  If either a comma or an equal sign occurs in a parameter's value, it must be quoted.
                  This means, when passing multiple properties the whole expression needs to be quoted:
                  <literal>-connectionProperties='someProp=42,otherProp=24'</literal>.
                </para>
                <para>
                  As an alternative, a colon can be used instead of the equals sign,
                  e.g <literal>-connectionProperties=someProp:42,otherProp:24</literal>. In this
                  case no quoting is needed (because no delimiter is part of the parameters value).
                </para>
                <para>
                  If any of the property values contain a comma or an equal sign, then the whole parameter value needs to be quoted again, even
                  when using a colon.
                  <literal>-connectionProperties='someProp:"answer=42",otherProp:"2,4"'</literal> will define the value <literal>answer=42</literal> for the
                  property <literal>someProp</literal> and the value 2,4 for the property <literal>otherProp</literal>.
                 </para>

                The <link linkend="understand-alternate-delim">alternate delimiter</link> to be used for this connection.
                e.g. <literal>-altDelimiter=GOl</literal> to define a SQL Server like GO as the
                alternate delimiter. Note that when running in batchmode you can also override
                the default delimiter by specifying the
                <link linkend="scripting-delimiter"><literal>-delimiter</literal></link> parameter.

              <entry>-connectionName</entry>
              <entry>
                When specifying a connection without a profile (only using <literal>-username</literal>, <literal>-password</literal>
                and so on) then the name of the connection can be defined using this parameter. The connection name
                will be shown in the title of the main window if &wb-productname; is started in GUI mode.
                The parameter does not have any visible effect when running in batch or console mode.
              </entry>

            <row>
              <entry>-workspace</entry>
              <entry>The workspace file to be loaded. If the file specification does not
              include a directory, the workspace will be loaded from the
              <link linkend="cmdline-parameter-configdir">configuration directory</link>. If this parameter
              is not specified, the default workspace (<literal>Default.wksp</literal>) will be loaded.

        If a value for one of the parameters contains a dash or a space, you will
        need to quote the parameter value.
      </para>

      <para>
        A disadvantage of this method is, that the password is displayed in plain text
        on the command line. If this is used in a batch file, the password will be stored
        in plain text in the batch file. If you don't want to expose the password,
        you can use a connection profile and <link linkend="options-encrypt-password">enable password encryption</link>
        for connection profiles.
