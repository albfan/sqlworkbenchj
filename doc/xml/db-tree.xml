      <title>Dropping elements into the SQL editor</title>
      <para>
        In general, dropping an element into the editor, will insert the element's name into the editor. There are
        however two exceptions to this rule:
        <simplelist columns="1">
          <member>dropping the "Columns" node of the tree, will insert a comma separated list of all columns</member>
          <member>dropping a table into a SELECT statement's column list will insert a comma separated list of all columns</member>
          <member>dropping a table into a position where not current SQL statement is located, a <literal>SELECT</literal> statement for the table will be inserted</member>
        </simplelist>
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="db-tree-data-display">
      <title>Displaying a table's data</title>
      <para>
        To display the data of a table, just drag the table node from the DB Object Tree to the result panel of the
        current SQL editor. &wb-productname; will then generate an approriate <literal>SELECT</literal> statement
        for the table and execute it immediately.
