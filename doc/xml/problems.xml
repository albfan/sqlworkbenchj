			<title>BLOB support is not working properly</title>
			<para>
				&wb-productname; supports reading and writing BLOB data in 
				various ways. The implementation relies on standard JDBC API calls
				to work properly in the driver. If you experience problems when updating
				BLOB columns (e.g. using the <link linkend="blob-support">enhanced</link> <literal>UPDATE, INSERT</literal>
				syntax or the <link linkend="data-pumper">DataPumper</link>)
				then please check the version of your Oracle JDBC driver. Only 10.x drivers 
				implement the necessary JDBC functions properly. The version of your driver
				is reported in the log file when you make a connection to your Oracle server.

		<section id="oracle-enable-remarks">
			<title>Table and column comments are not displayed</title>
			<para>
				By default Oracle's JDBC driver does not return comments made on columns or tables 
				(<literal>COMMENT ON ..</literal>). Thus your comments will not be shown in the database 
				explorer.
			</para>
			<para>
				To enable the display of column comments, you need to pass the property <literal>remarksReporting</literal>
				to the driver.
			</para>
			<para>
				In the profile dialog, click on the <guibutton>Extended Properties</guibutton> button.
				Add a new property in the following window with the name <literal>remarksReporting</literal>
				and the value <literal>true</literal>. Now close the dialog by clicking on the OK button.
			</para>
			<para>
				Turning on this features slows down the retrieval of table information e.g. in the Database Explorer.
			</para>
			<para>
				When you have comments defined in your Oracle database and use the <link linkend="command-schema-report">WbReport</link>
				command, then you have to enable the remrks reporting, otherwise the comments will not show up in the report.

			<title>"Operation not allowed" error message</title>
			<para>
				In case you receive an error message "<literal>Operation not allowed after ResultSet closed</literal>"
				please upgrade your JDBC driver to a more recent version. This problem was fixed with the MySQL JDBC
				driver version 3.1. So upgrading to that or any later version will fix this problem.

		<section id="mysql-zero-date-problems">
			<title>Problems with zero dates with MySQL</title>
			<para>
				MySQL allows the user to store invalid dates in the database (0000-00-00). Since 
				version 3.1 of the JDBC driver, the driver will throw an exception when trying to retrieve
				such an invalid date. This behaviour can be controlled by adding an <link linkend="profile-extended-properties">extended property</link>
				to the connection profile. The property should be named <literal>zeroDateTimeBehavior</literal>. You can
				set this value to either <literal>convertToNull</literal> or to <literal>round</literal>. For details
				see <ulink url="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/connector-j-installing-upgrading.html">the MySQL site</ulink>

		<title>DB2 Problems</title>

		<section id="db2-charset">
			<title>"Connection closed" errors</title>
			<para>
				When using the DB2 JDBC drivers it is important that the <literal>charsets.jar</literal> 
				is part of the used JDK (or JRE). Apparently the DB2 JDBC driver needs this library in 
				order to correctly convert the EBCDIC characterset (used in the database) into the 
				Unicode encoding that is used by Java.
				The library <literal>charsets.jar</literal> is usually included in all multi-language
				JDK/JRE installations. 
			</para>
			<para>
				If you experience intermittent "Connection closed" errors when running SQL statements,
				please verify that <literal>charsets.jar</literal> is part of your JDK/JRE installation.
				This file is usually installed in <literal>jre\lib\charsets.jar</literal>.
