      When using databases that support timestamps or time data with a timezone, the display in &wb-productname; might not
      always be correct. Especially when daylight savings time (DST) is in effect.

    <para>
      If your time data is not displayed correctly, you might try to explicitely specify the timezone when starting the application.
      This is done by passing the system property <literal>-Duser.timezone=XYZ</literal> to the application, where XYZ
      is the timezone where the computer is located that runs &wb-productname;
    </para>
    <para>
      The timezone should be specified relativ to GMT and not with a logical name. If you are in Germany and DST is active, you need
      to use <literal>-Duser.timezone=GMT+2</literal>. Specifying <literal>-Duser.timezone=Europe/Berlin</literal> does usually
      <emphasis role="bold">not</emphasis> work.

      If you experience problems when running &wb-productname; (or
      other Java/Swing based applications) on the Windows&reg; platform, this
      might be due to problems with the graphics driver and/or the

			<title>No Views or tables visible in the DbExplorer</title>
      <indexterm><primary>Oracle</primary><secondary>No views displayed in DbExplorer</secondary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>Oracle</primary><secondary>Tables with underscores not treated correctly</secondary></indexterm>
			<para>
        Since Build 112 it is possible that the DbExplorer does no longer display views or tables if the
        selected schema (username) contains an underscore. This is caused by a bug in older Oracle JDBC drivers.
			</para>
      <para>
        The driver calls used to display the list of tables and views in a specific schema expects a wildcard expression.
        To avoid listing the objects for <literal>USERX1</literal> when displaying the objects for <literal>USER_1</literal>
        the underscore must be escaped. The driver will create an expression similar to <literal>AND owner LIKE 'USER_1' ESCAPE '\'</literal>
        (which would return tables for <literal>USERA1</literal>, <literal>USERB1</literal> and so on, including of course
        <literal>USER_1</literal>).
      </para>
      <para>
        The character that is used to escape the wildcards is reported by the driver. &wb-productname; sends e.g. the
        value <literal>USER\_1</literal> if the driver reports that a backslash is used to escape wildcards.
      </para>
      <para>
        However some older Oracle drivers report the wrong escape character, so the value sent to the database results in
        <literal>AND owner LIKE 'USER\_1' ESCAPE '/'</literal>. The backslash in the expression is the character
        <emphasis>reported</emphasis> by the driver, whereas the forward slash in the expression is the character
        actually <emphasis>used</emphasis> by the driver.
      </para>
      <para>
        To fix this problem, the escape character reported by the driver can be overridden by setting a property in <literal>workbench.settings</literal>:
      </para>
      <para>
        <literal>workbench.db.oracle.searchstringescape=/</literal>
      </para>
      <para>You can also change this property by running</para>
      <programlisting>WbSetConfig workbench.db.oracle.searchstringescape=/</programlisting>

        This bug was fixed in the 11.2 drivers.

        The content of columns with the data type <literal>XMLTYPE</literal> cannot be displayed by &wb-productname; because

      <para>
        The only way to retrieve and update XMLType columns using &wb-productname; is to cast the columns to a CLOB

		  <para>
				Microsoft SQL Server (at least up to 2000) does not support concurrent reads and writes
				to the database very well. Especially when using DDL statements, this can lead to
				database locks that can freeze the application. This affects e.g. the display of the tables
				in the DbExplorer.	As the JDBC driver needs to issue a SELECT statement to retrieve the table
				information, this can be blocked by e.g. a non-committed <literal>CREATE ... </literal>
				statement as that will lock the system table(s) that store the meta information about tables
				and views.
		  </para>
			<para>
				Unfortunately there is no real solution to blocking transactions e.g. between a SQL tab and the
				DbExplorer. One (highly discouraged) solution is to run in autocommit mode, the other to have
				only one connection for all tabs (thus all of them share the same transaction an the DbExplorer
				cannot be blocked by a different SQL tab).
			</para>
			<para>
				The Microsoft JDBC Driver supports a connection property called <literal>lockTimeout</literal>.
				It is recommended to set that to 0 (zero) (or a similar low value). If that is done, calls
				to the driver's API will through an error if they encounter a lock rather than waiting
				until the lock is released. The jTDS driver does not support such a property. If you are using

      <para>
        The jTDS driver and the Microsoft JDBC driver read the complete result set into memory
        before returning it to the calling application. This means that when retrieving
        data, &wb-productname; uses (for a short amount of time) twice as much memory as really
        needed. This also means that <link linkend="command-export">WbExport</link> or <link linkend="command-copy">WbCopy</link> will
        effectively read the entire result into memory before writing it into the output file.
        For large exports this us usually not wanted.
      </para>
      <para>
        This behaviour of the drivers can be changed by adding an additional parameter to the
        JDBC URL that is used to connect to the database. For the jTDS driver append
        <literal>useCursors=true</literal> to the URL, e.g.
        <literal>jdbc:jtds:sqlserver://localhost:2068;useCursors=true</literal>

      <para>
        For the Microsoft driver, use the parameter <literal>selectMethod=cursor</literal> to
        switch to a cursor based retrieval that does not buffer all rows within the driver, e.g.

			<para>
				When using the DB2 JDBC drivers it is important that the <literal>charsets.jar</literal>

				The library <literal>charsets.jar</literal> is usually included in all multi-language
				JDK/JRE installations.
			</para>

				If you experience intermittent "Connection closed" errors when running SQL statements,
				please verify that <literal>charsets.jar</literal> is part of your JDK/JRE installation.

      <para>
        The PostgreSQL JDBC driver defaults to buffer the results obtained from the database
        in memory before returning them to the application. This means that when retrieving
        data, &wb-productname; uses (for a short amount of time) twice as much memory as really
        needed. This also means that <link linkend="command-export">WbExport</link> or <link linkend="command-copy">WbCopy</link> will
        effectively read the entire result into memory before writing it into the output file.
        For large exports this us usually not wanted.
      </para>
      <para>
        This behaviour of the driver can be changed so that the driver uses cursor based retrieval.
        To do this, the connection profile must disable the "Autocommit" option, and must define
        a default fetch size that is greater than zero. A recommended value is e.g. 10, it might be
        that higher numbers give a better performance. The number defined for the fetch size,
        defines the number of rows the driver keeps in its internal buffer before requesting more
        rows from the backend.
      </para>

		<section id="pg-statement-savepoint">
			<title>Getting the error: Current transaction is aborted</title>
			<para>
				PostgreSQL marks a complete transaction as failed if a only single statement fails.
        In such a case the transaction cannot be committed, e.g.
				consider the following script:
			</para>
			<programlisting>INSERT INTO person (id, firstname, lastname) VALUES (1, 'Arthur', 'Dent');
INSERT INTO person (id, firstname, lastname) VALUES (2, 'Zaphod', 'Beeblebrox');
INSERT INTO person (id, firstname, lastname) VALUES (2, 'Ford', 'Prefect');
COMMIT;</programlisting>
			<para>
				As the ID column is the primary key, the third insert will fail with a unique key violation.
				In PostgreSQL you cannot commit anyway and thus persist the first two <literal>INSERT</literal>s.
			</para>
			<para>
				This problem can only be solved by using a SAVEPOINT before and after each
				statement. In case that statement fails, the transaction can be rolled back to the state
				before the statement and the reminder of the script can execute.
			</para>
			<para>
				Doing this manually is quite tedious, so you can tell &wb-productname; to do this
				automatically for you by setting the properties:
			</para>
			<programlisting>workbench.db.postgresql.ddl.usesavepoint=true
workbench.db.postgresql.sql.usesavepoint=true
</programlisting>
			<para>
				in the file <link linkend="settings">workbench.settings</link>. If this is enabled,
        &wb-productname; will issue a <literal>SET SAVEPOINT</literal> before running each statement
        and will release the savepoint after the statement. If the statement failed, a rollback to the
        savepoint will be issued that will mark the transaction as "clean" again. So in the above
        example (with <literal>sql.usesavepoint</literal> set to <literal>true</literal>), the last
        statement would be rolled back automatically but the first two <literal>INSERT</literal>s
        can be committed (this will also required to turn on the "Ignore errors" option is enabled).
      </para>

      <para>
        If you want to use the modes <link linkend="import-update-mode"><literal>update/insert</literal></link> or
				<link linkend="import-update-mode"><literal>insert/update</literal></link>
				for <link linkend="command-import">WbImport</link>, you should also add the
				property:
			</para>
			<programlisting>workbench.db.postgresql.import.usesavepoint=true</programlisting>
      <para>
        to enable the usage of savepoints during imports. This setting also affects
        the <literal>WbCopy</literal> command.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can also use the parameter <literal>-useSavepoint</literal> for the
        <literal>WbImport</literal> and <literal>WbCopy</literal> commands to control the use of
        savepoints for each import.
      </para>
      <para>
        Using savepoints can slow down the import substantially.
