      <title>New ${pub.build.name} build (${pub.build.number}) released</title>
      <description>        <![CDATA[<p>Changes from build 104.2 to build 104.3</p><p>Enhancements</p><ul>
<li>A new parameter for WbExport is available: -sourceTablePrefix that defines a common prefix for all tables defined through -sourceTable. The prefix will be appended to all table names without any changes.</li>
</ul><p>Bug Fixes</p><ul>
<li>The "Object Info" feature did not work on Postgres if the selected object was a view.</li>
<li>In Oracle running a SELECT using a table name that was also used as a global symbol, the generated statements for changes in the result set referenced the schema PUBLIC instead of the current schema.</li>
<li>When re-ordering the columns using drag-and-drop and then displaying the single-record dialog, the content of the columns was mixed up.</li>
<li>When re-ordering the columns using drag-and-drop, the order was reset when changing data in the result.</li>

      <title>New development build (104.2) released</title>
      <description>        <![CDATA[<p>Changes from build 104.1 to build 104.2</p><p>Enhancements</p><ul>
<li>A new option to display information about database objects is available through "SQL -&gt; Object Info". If text is selected in the editor, this action will try to find a DB object with the name that is indicated by the selected text. It will look for tables, views, synonyms, sequences, procedures/functions and triggers. If something is found the definition (e.g. the list of columns) is displayed as a result set in the current SQL tab (the result will be appended). For objects with only a SQL source (e.g. a procedure) the source will be written into the messages tab.</li>
<li>When specifying date/time format string (e.g. when importing a file or in the options dialog), the input is now validated and an error message is shown.</li>
</ul><p>Bug Fixes</p><ul>
<li>The alternate delimiter was not always processed correctly.</li>
<li>When using the DataPumper to import text files and an invalid date format was specified, no table columns could be selected.</li>
<li>The -schemas parameter for WbReport was ignored.</li>
<li>When loading a new file into the editor while an error selection was present, the selection was still shown after the new file was loaded.</li>
</ul>

      <title>New development build (104.1) released</title>
      <description>        <![CDATA[<p>Changes from build 104.0 to build 104.1</p><p>Enhancements</p><ul>
<li>The SQL Macros can now be displayed in a floating window. Double clicking a macro will run the macro in the currently selected SQL tab.</li>
<li>The generation of the source SQL for a table can now be configured in order to use the functions the DBMS supports (e.g. SHOW CREATE TABLE for MySQL), so that incompatibilities of the DBMS with the ANSI SQL standard can be worked around. A detailed description is in the manual in the section "Customize table source retrieval" of the chapter "Properties in the .settings file"</li>
<li>When using WbExport to generate HTML two new parameters can be used to specify HTML code that is added before and after the actual export data (-preDataHtml, -postDataHtml)</li>
</ul><p>Bug Fixes</p><ul>
<li>When prompting vor variables, entering an empty value would remove the variable from the internal variables pool. It is now stored with an empty string as its value.</li>
<li>(Un)Comment selection did not work if the cursor was in the very first column and no lines where selected.</li>
<li>For WbCopy -createTarget was not working if the source was a query.</li>
</ul>

<li>Manually changed column order in the table data of the DbExplorer can now be saved. Either manually through the popup menu of the table header, or automatically through an option for the DbExplorer.</li>
<li>When defining the jar library for a Look &amp; Feel, the application now scans the libraries for the approriate classes</li>

<li>If a profile did not have a name, SQL Workbench failed to display the connection dialog.</li>
<li>The current database was not selected in the DbExplorer for DBMS using Catalogs instead of Schemas (e.g. MySQL)</li>
<li>Reformatting WbVarDef would incorrectly replace it with WbVarDefine</li>
<li>Workspace -&gt; Assign Workspace was no longer working</li>
<li>When "Automatically optimize row height" was enabled, sorting a result set would not redraw the table correctly.</li>
