      <title>New stable build (112) released</title>
      <description>        <![CDATA[<p>Changes from build 111 to build 112</p><p>Enhancements</p><ul>
<li>PostgreSQL's "infinity" values for DATE and TIMESTAMP columns are now displayed and parsed correctly</li>
<li>The busy and cancelling indicator for a SQL panel can now be selected in the options panel</li>
<li>The editor now supports "Find previous"</li>
<li>A new option to blend the selection color with the column highlight color is available</li>
<li>A new option to copy all column names of a result is available (thanks Andreas)</li>
<li>For Oracle the SQL for temporary tables is now generated correctly.</li>
<li>The notification about a finished (long running) script can now optionally be done using the system tray.</li>
<li>Enhanced the behaviour of the editor when when typing while a rectangular selection is active.</li>
<li>Implemented a workaround for Firebird JDBC driver which does not return function based indexes (and thus they were not shown in the DbExplorer)</li>
<li>Code completion now honors the setting of the "search_path" in PostgreSQL</li>
<li>The schema and catalog filters in a connection profile can not be defined as "inclusion" filters that define the list of names to be displayed (rather than a list of names to be excluded)</li>
<li>For Oracle and Postgres a check for uncommitted changes can be enabled in the connection profile (for Oracle this requires the SELECT privileges on V$TRANSACTION)</li>
<li>For Oracle, the "autotrace" mode from SQL*Plus is now supported. It is enabled with "SET AUTOTRACE" the same as in SQL*Plus (and requires the PLUSTRACE role like SQL*Plus)</li>
<li>A new option to generate a script to drop a table and all incoming (referencing) foreign keys is available in the DbExplorer. This functionality is also available through the WbGenerateDrop command</li>
<li>If enabled, the formatting of internally generated SQL statements is now done by the SQL formatter (and thus uses the same settings as the formatter)</li>
<li>The dependency tree in the DbExplorer can now be limited to the direct children only.</li>
<li>A new option for WbDataDiff is available to define alternate key columns for each table. See the manual for details.</li>

<li>For Oracle a subset of the SQL*Plus SHOW command is now supported</li>
<li>A new option is available to automatically save connection profiles if the connect dialog is closed with OK.</li>
<li>Enhanced entering variables in the variable dialog. The ENTER key automatically advances to the next variable and closes the dialog after the last one.</li>
<li>When using WbVarDef with -contentFile, variables in the source file are now replaced. This can be disabled using the parameter -replaceVars=false</li>
<li>The save button to update the database can now be set to be always enabled by setting the property workbench.gui.savebutton.always.enabled=true in workbench.settings</li>
<li>A new option has been added to highlight columns that have been changed.</li>
<li>The contents for a variable can now be read from an external file (using WbVarDef -variable=foo -contentFile=bar.txt)</li>
<li>A new option to enable a connection to Oracle using the role SYSDBA has been added to the connection profile. This removes the need to specify an extended property.</li>
<li>The dependency tree in the DbExplorer can now be retrieved independently from the list of foreign keys. Additionally the automatic retrieval of the tree can now be disabled in the options dialog.</li>
<li>A new command "WbSysExec" has been added to run external programs.</li>
<li>For H2 the (SQL) source for linked tables is now correctly shown in the DbExplorer.</li>
<li>A new option for WbImport is available to control the behaviour with empty files</li>
<li>For Postgres the generated CREATE TABLE statements now includes storage and tablespace information</li>
</ul><p>Bug Fixes</p><ul>
<li>In the editor, regular expressions that anchored at the start or end of a line did not work.</li>
<li>Fixed several problems for DB2 on iSeries</li>
<li>Autocompletion for tables and columns was not working with MySQL</li>
<li>Results of SELECT statements could no longer be updated for MySQL</li>
<li>The DbExplorer did not work for PostgreSQL versions before 8.3</li>
<li>On MacOS it was no longer possible to close the application using the "Command-Q" shortcut.</li>
<li>In the DbExplorer changes to the data display colors were only applied when re-opening the DbExplorer</li>
<li>For H2 unnamed check constraint where not shown in the generated SQL source</li>
<li>Date and timestamp columns where not properly formatted when exported to OpenOffice</li>
<li>If a column alias was used, the alias name was not used when exporting the result (WbExport or using Save Data As)</li>
<li>"Delete word" would delete too much if the caret was located at a whitespace</li>
<li>Fixed a problem with detecting tables for DB2 iSeries and the library search path.</li>
<li>No columns were shown in the DbExplorer for Vertica when the table or view name contained an underscore.</li>
<li>For DB2, the source code for views created using CREATE OR REPLACE was not shown correctly.</li>
<li>Adding a new column in the DbExplorer was not working for DBMS that do not support renaming of columns.</li>
<li>A CASE statement with a column alias not using the AS keyword word was not always formatted correctly.</li>
<li>When specifying a non-existing table using -sourceTable for WbExport no proper error message was shown.</li>
<li>Fixed a problem with displaying the menus if the editor tabs ran over more than one line</li>
<li>Implemented a workaround for the Vertica JDBC driver to allow running DML statements.</li>
<li>WbSchemaDiff did not work when the table names needed quoting because of special characters or mixed case names</li>
<li>The ACTION part for foreign key definitions was displayed incorrectly in the generated SQL source and the "References Tab" of DbExplorer</li>
<li>Running more than one DataPumper or WbCopy command in parallel did not work.</li>
<li>Displaying the source code for functions did not always work properly in PostgreSQL</li>
<li>Copy as SQL UPDATE did not work properly</li>
<li>If more than one statement was selected, reformatting the SQL would remove the delimiter</li>
<li>Implemented a workaround for a bug in old MySQL drivers that would cause an error when processing the result of a SELECT statement</li>

      <title>New stable build (110) released</title>
      <description>        <![CDATA[<p>Changes from build 109 to build 110</p><p>Enhancements</p><ul>
<li>The (self-written) Windows launcher has been dropped and replaced with executables from Winrun4J, including suppport for 64bit executables (thanks to Markus for testing this).</li>
<li>EXPLAIN is now supported for auto-completion (PostgreSQL, Oracle, MySQL)</li>
<li>The DbExplorer will now show the status of Oracle stored procedures.</li>
<li>The DbExplorer now includes information about partitioned tables and indexes for Oracle in the generated source.</li>
<li>The possibility to influence the generated INSERT statement for WbImport is now available as a commandline parameter (previously this was only possible through a property in workbench.settings).</li>
<li>Two new options for the SQL Formatter are available that control the placement of the comma when line breaks are inserted. Thanks to Andreas for this patch.</li>
<li>The option "Allow empty line as statement delimiter" has been moved into the settings dialog and is now also being used when detecting the current statement in the editor.</li>
<li>The font size of the editor can now be changed dynamically using Ctrl-Numpad Plus/Ctrl-Numpad Minus or via the scroll wheel of the mouse (holding down the Ctrl Key). The font size of a result table can be changed using the scroll wheel or through the context menu in the table header.</li>
<li>It is now (optionally) possible to modify the text in the editor while a statement is running. Statement and error highlighting will not be available if the editor contents was modified during execution.</li>
<li>When the option "Show Max. Rows warning" is enabled, the warning is now shown using an icon in the tab header (instead of changing the color).</li>
<li>The join condition inside a JOIN part of a SELECT statement can now be generated automatically (if the tables involved are using foreign keys) using SQL -&gt; JOIN completion</li>
<li>Primary key columns are now shown in bold face in the auto-completion popup window. If comments are defined for columns, tables or view, these will be shown as a tooltip for the entry in the popup</li>
<li>A new parameter -skipTargetCheck is available for WbCopy to disable checking of the target table. This is useful if the target table is not visible by the JDBC driver (e.g. temporary tables for Informix)</li>

<li>When selecting JdbcOdbc bridge as the Driver class, SQL Workbench incorrectly showed an error message that the driver could not be found.</li>
<li>Copying a table's column definitions into the clipboard did not work.</li>
<li>When using WbCopy and -createTarget with a fully qualified table name (otherschema.sometable) the table was not created in the specified schema</li>
<li>Postgres DOMAINs where not displayed if the DOMAIN was created in a schema that is not in the schema search_path</li>
<li>A selection of '*' in the DbExplorer's schema selector was not restored if "Remember DbExplorer schema" was enabled for the workspace</li>

      <title>New stable build (108) released</title>
      <description>        <![CDATA[<p>Changes from build 107 to build 108</p><p>Enhancements</p><ul>
<li>The argument parser for Workbench specific commands has been changed in order to recognize empty values (e.g. -replaceWith=' ') Existing scripts should work, but it could be that some combinations of parameter values are not covered by my tests. So please verify that your scripts still work with the new version.</li>
<li>A new option for WbExport (-replaceValues) is available to replace text (using regular expressions) in all character columns during export.</li>
<li>For Oracle the DbExplorer will now also show OBJECT TYPEs</li>
<li>For DB2 the list of procedures is no long retrieved through the driver, so that functions will also be shown in the DbExplorer.</li>
<li>When using a JDBC 4.0 compliant driver the table definition in the DbExplorer will now also display the IS_AUTOINCREMENT flag. (with pre-JDBC 4.0 drivers the column will always display NO)</li>
<li>For SQL Server, column and table remarks that are defined through sp_addextendedproperty() are now retrieved and displayed in the DbExplorer.</li>
<li>Computed/Virtual columns are now shown in a table's SQL for Firebird, H2 Database, HSQLDB 2.0, Oracle 11g, DB2 (LUW) and SQL Server 2005</li>
<li>The DbExplorer will now show the (correct) source code for user defined AGGREGATEs in PostgreSQL</li>
<li>When running stored procedures with parameters, the name of the parameters are now shown in the parameter input dialog if available. If running stored procedures with out parameters, the result tabs will be named after the parameters now (if the parameter names are available)</li>
<li>The minimum version for POI (XLS export) has been raised to 3.5 in order to support Microsoft's new OfficeOpen XML Format. Therefor the naming of export types has been changed: xls still writes the old (Pre 2003) binary format, xlsx now writes the new OOXML format (Office 2007) and the (new) type xlsm writes the Office 2003 XML format (xlsm is equivalent to the previous xlsx type). To be able to use the new xlsx format, additonal libraries (apart from poi.jar) are needed: poi-ooxml.jar, dom4j-1.6.1.jar, geronimo-stax-api_1.0_spec-1.0.jar, ooxml-schemas-1.0.jar and xmlbeans-2.3.0.jar</li>
<li>Two new options for spreadsheet export have been added. An option to turn on the auto-filter for ODS and Excel XML exports (-autoFilter). An option -fixedHeader to freeze header row which is available for all three formats. Both options are turned on by default.</li>
<li>A new option has been added to highlight the result tab when the number of rows defined in the "Max. Rows" setting has been reached. (Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Data display -&gt; Show Max Rows. warning)</li>
<li>A new commandline option for specifying the connection in batch mode has been added. Using -connectionProperties extended properties for the JDBC driver can be passed on the commandline. As the properties need to be specified as key value pairs the value has to be quoted, e.g. -connectionProperties='myprop=somevalue'</li>
<li>A new entry to control the usage of the table's schema in an SQL export (WbExport -type=sqlinsert) has been added. This overwrites the default setting from the options dialog (Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; SQL Generation)</li>
<li>For results the row numbers can now also be displayed (similar to the line numbers in the editor)</li>
<li>Oracle object type columns are now displayed correctly. As this is a generic solution to display JDBC "Struct" values, it should work for any driver that returns the correct type.</li>
<li>Integrated the JLine library to allow command line editing for console mode on Linux (and other Unix like systems).</li>
<li>A new command WbListSchemas is available.</li>
<li>A new option (-infoSheet=true) is available for spreadsheets exports (ods, xlsx, xls) to append an additional worksheet that contains the SQL that generated the export.</li>
<li>A new option (-tableWhere="....") is available for WbExport to append a WHERE clause to all tables that are exported (e.g. WHERE modified_date &gt; DATE '2010-01-01')</li>
<li>The behaviour of the quick search for the auto-completion can now be configured. A new option "Partial match" will allow search anywhere in the listed objects (not just at the start). Another option allows to filter the displayed items according to the quick search value (instead of simply jumping to the first matching item). Alphabetic sorting of table columns can now be disabled (in that case, the columns are listed in the order as returned by the database). The new options have been moved to a separate page in the options dialog</li>
<li>When toggling the option "Allow table altering" for the DbExplorer, this is now immediately reflected in any open DbExplorer (previously after changing the option the DbExplorer had to be closed and re-opened)</li>
<li>For query results, the column comments can now also be retrieved. The column comments (if available) are then displayed in the tooltip of the result's column header. The retrieval can be enabled in Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Data display -&gt; Retrieve column remarks for queries</li>
<li>WbExport can now also write a "control" file for DB2's IMPORT command (-formatFile=db2)</li>
<li>A message box can now be displayed when all running scripts have been finished. If the application is minimized, displaying the message box will also restore the application's main window.</li>
</ul><p>Bug Fixes</p><ul>
<li>Setting the loglevel for the built-in logger was no longer working</li>
<li>Displaying the definition for cross-schema synonyms was no longer working.</li>
<li>WbSchemaDiff did not run in batch mode when procedures where included. Thanks to Denis for finding this.</li>
<li>Activating the column filter in a table's column list in the DbExplorer did not work when hitting enter in the input field.</li>
<li>When quoting column names for WbCopy's column mapping, the quoted columns where not detected properly (e.g. -columns='name/"Name", id/"Id"')</li>
<li>The new "show max rows warning" option does not work for all Look &amp; Feels. Some ignore the setting of a background color. If changing the background color is not supported the text of the result tab is now displayed in the chosen color.</li>
<li>Fixed some more corner cases where the new row number display was not in sync with the result.</li>
<li>The new row number display was not always in sync with the result table.</li>
<li>Defined schema or catalog filters in the connection profile were not displayed correctly (even though they were stored correctly).</li>
<li>Exporting only some of the columns of a result using "Save As" did not work.</li>
<li>When using "Save Data As" to export a result set, the settings for an Excel export where not saved</li>
<li>The current schema and database of the DbExplorer were not always saved correctly in the workspace.</li>
<li>Stored procedures that used a REF CURSOR as an INOUT parameter could not be executed using WbCall</li>
<li>If a table with the same name existed in two schemas, the DataPumper would show the coloumns for both tables, not just the selected one.</li>
<li>The option to display row numbers for results was not saved from within the options dialog</li>
<li>WbSchemaDiff reported the compared sequences as procedure-info in the diff summary</li>
<li>The dialog to choose the update table for a multi-join SELECT result can now be resized</li>
<li>When moving a macro from one group to another using drag and drop (instead of Cut &amp; Paste) the change was not applied.</li>
<li>When copying the data of a result set into the clipboard, the column headers were not copied when the keyboard shortcut was used.</li>
<li>When moving a DbExplorer away from the end, the tabs were not restored correctly when loading the workspace later.</li>
<li>Some properties for SQL generation were not migrated correctly from previous versions</li>
<li>Setting the editor color for datatypes changed the color for the cursor (and vice versa)</li>
<li>When changing inet, macaddr or cidr columns in the result set, wrong statements were generated for PostgreSQL</li>
</ul>

To be able to use the new xlsx format, additonal libraries (apart from poi.jar) are needed: poi-ooxml.jar, dom4j-1.6.1.jar, geronimo-stax-api_1.0_spec-1.0.jar, ooxml-schemas-1.0.jar and xmlbeans-2.3.0.jar</li>
<li>Two new options for spreadsheet export have been added. An option to turn on the auto-filter for ODS and Excel XML exports (-autoFilter). An option -fixedHeader to freeze header row which is available for all three formats. Both options are turned on by default.</li>
<li>A new option has been added to highlight the result tab when the number of rows defined in the "Max. Rows" setting has been reached. (Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Data display -&gt; Show Max Rows. warning)</li>
<li>A new commandline option for specifying the connection in batch mode has been added. Using -connectionProperties extended properties for the JDBC driver can be passed on the commandline. As the properties need to be specified as key value pairs the value has to be quoted, e.g. -connectionProperties='myprop=somevalue'</li>
<li>A new entry to control the usage of the table's schema in an SQL export (WbExport -type=sqlinsert) has been added. This overwrites the default setting from the options dialog (Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; SQL Generation)</li>
</ul><p>Bug Fixes</p><ul>
<li>When using "Save Data As" to export a result set, the settings for an Excel export where not saved</li>
<li>Stored procedures that used a REF CURSOR as an INOUT parameter could not be executed using WbCall</li>
</ul>

<li>For results the row numbers can now also be displayed (similar to the line numbers in the editor)</li>
<li>Oracle object type columns are now displayed correctly. As this is a generic solution to display JDBC "Struct" values, it should work for any driver that returns the correct type.</li>

      <title>New development build (107.2) released</title>
      <description>        <![CDATA[<p>Changes from build 107.1 to build 107.2</p><p>Enhancements</p><ul>
<li>Integrated the JLine library to allow command line editing for console mode on Linux (and other Unix like systems).</li>
<li>A new command WbListSchemas is available.</li>
<li>A new option (-infoSheet=true) is available for spreadsheets exports (ods, xlsx, xls) to append an additional worksheet that contains the SQL that generated the export.</li>
<li>A new option (-tableWhere="....") is available for WbExport to append a WHERE clause to all tables that are exported (e.g. WHERE modified_date &gt; DATE '2010-01-01')</li>
<li>The behaviour of the quick search for the auto-completion can now be configured. A new option "Partial match" will allow search anywhere in the listed objects (not just at the start). Another option allows to filter the displayed items according to the quick search value (instead of simply jumping to the first matching item). Alphabetic sorting of table columns can now be disabled (in that case, the columns are listed in the order as returned by the database). The new options have been moved to a separate page in the options dialog</li>
</ul><p>Bug Fixes</p><ul>
<li>WbSchemaDiff reported the compared sequences as procedure-info in the diff summary</li>
<li>The dialog to choose the update table for a multi-join SELECT result can now be resized</li>
<li>When moving a macro from one group to another using drag and drop (instead of Cut &amp; Paste) the change was not applied.</li>
<li>When copying the data of a result set into the clipboard, the column headers were not copied when the keyboard shortcut was used.</li>
</ul>

      <title>New stable build (107) released</title>
      <description>        <![CDATA[<p>Changes from build 106 to build 107</p><p>Enhancements</p><ul>
<li>SQL Workbench/J now requires Java 6.</li>
<li>Changing column definitions or renaming tables directly in the DbExplorer can be now disabled in the Options dialog.</li>
<li>The connection profile has a new option to filter schema and catalog names from the dropdown in the DbExplorer.</li>
<li>A new option to keep the highlight when using "Highlight current statement" has been added (Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Editor)</li>
<li>A new option to set the default value for the Max. Rows field when opening new tabs is available (Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Data Display)</li>
<li>UTF and ISO encodings can now be entered (e.g. for WbExport or WbImport) without dashes: UTF8, UTF16, iso88591. They will be converted internally to the correct names.</li>
<li>Log4J logging can also be turned on by supplying a configuration file as a parameter for workbench.log.log4j so that log4j.xml does not need to be in the directory where sqlworkbench.jar is located.</li>
<li>Peter Franken contributed a Log4J integration for SQL Workbench/J. In order to use Log4j, the library log4j.jar (without a version number) must be present in the directory where sqlworkbench.jar is located. The log4j.xml must also be placed into that directory. To turn on log4j logging, the property workbench.log.log4j must be set to true (either in workbench.settings or as a system property) If log4j is used, none of the logging properties from workbench.settings will be applied. Log4j must be completely configured through log4j.xml.</li>
<li>Blobs can now be exported and imported as "text values" by encoding the binary values (hex or unicode).</li>
<li>sqlwbconsole.exe can now also be used to run SQL Workbench in batch mode (e.g. sqlwbconsole.exe -script=do_something.sql)</li>
<li>A new menu item "File -&gt; Close Window" is available to close the current window.</li>
<li>For JDBC 4 drivers that support the SQLXML type, XML columns are now displayed directly (without the need to use casting or similar methods). Currently it seems that only Postgres and DB2 have implemented this properly in their driver.</li>
<li>A new option to control the behaviour when closing a tab has been added. If "Activate the last used tab" is enabled, closing a tab will no longer select the "next" tab, but the previously used one. The new option is enabled by default.</li>
<li>When opening a file from the the main menu (File -&gt; Open), the file can now be opened in a new editor tab.</li>
<li>Columns can now be added from within the DbExplorer's table definition panel</li>
<li>The generated source for inherited tables in Postgres now shows the parent table</li>
<li>WbSchemaDiff and WbReport now include triggers.</li>
<li>WbDataDiff can now output the result as XML files.</li>
<li>The WbXslt command can now handle stylesheets that include other stylesheets.</li>
<li>In the macro editor auto completion is now enabled (if the main window is connected)</li>
<li>workbench.settings will now only retain those properties that differ from the built-in defaults. This makes rolling out changes to the defaults easier. Any property that has been customized will remain in workbench.settings (but will not benefit from bugfixes made to the default properties)</li>
<li>Result tabs, can now be re-orderd using drag and drop.</li>
<li>The column definition of tables in the DbExplorer can now be edited and the approriate ALTER statement can be generated for the changes. Primary keys can be dropped and created from within the column definition.</li>
<li>Tables (and other objects if the database supports this) can now be renamed from within the table list of the DbExplorer. The comment for a table can also be changed. To apply the changes a new menu option in the context menu is available to generate and run the necessary ALTER statements.</li>
<li>The editor and resultset tabs can now have their own close button. (Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; General)</li>
<li>For SQL Server 2005 and above, synonyms are now retrieved in the DbExplorer.</li>
</ul><p>Bug Fixes</p><ul>
<li>The trigger list panel (where all triggers where shown) was not working any longer.</li>
<li>When copying a column name from the header's popup, the wrong name was copied when the columns where re-arranged using drag&amp;drop.</li>
<li>Fixed wrong formatting of multiple common table expressions (WITH .. AS) and multiple tuples for a VALUES expression.</li>
<li>The (search) history dropdowns were filled in the wrong order (the oldest entry was the first entry)</li>
<li>Using WbCall with a fully qualified procedure that returned a REF CURSOR did not work.</li>
<li>The navigation for referencing/referenced rows was no longer available in the DbExplorer's data tab.</li>
<li>Domain and Enum information was not displayed in the DbExplorer for Postgres versions before 8.4</li>
<li>When using WbDataDiff with tables where the column names differed in their case "FirstName" vs. "firstname" the generated UPDATE or INSERT statements were wrong. WbDataDiff now considers column names that only differ in their case as identical.</li>
<li>The new "Add column" feature was only configured for PostgreSQL</li>
<li>Retrieving columns with type "timestamp" did not work for SQL Server.</li>
<li>When adding a new column in the DbExplorer, column comments were not included.</li>
<li>When reformatting statements, workbench variables that contained an underscore (e.g. $[my_id]) where not detected correctly (and thus the statement was not formatted correctly)</li>
<li>The (table independent) trigger list panel in the DbExplorer did not show the trigger source correctly if multiple triggers had the same name.</li>
<li>Execute current was not working for MySQL connections.</li>
<li>If tables were created using double quotes (e.g. CREATE TABLE "MyTable"), the table details were no longer displayed in the DbExplorer</li>
<li>If a connection script was defined in the connection profile, an error was displayed during connect (even though the connection script was executed correctly)</li>
<li>The settings of the DbExplorer where not saved when the DbExplorer was opened as a separate window.</li>
<li>When using "Highlight Current statement" and executing the statement at the cursor (Execute Current), the statement was not highlighted when an error occurred.</li>
<li>"Execute current" was not working any longer.</li>
<li>The editor color for datatypes selected in the options dialog was not used.</li>
<li>The "Show Single Record Dialog" menu item in the table's popup menu was not always enabled.</li>
<li>When copying a macro, the keyboard shortcut was copied as well.</li>
<li>When cancelling the prompt to define an update table for a multi-table SELECT statement, an error was displayed.</li>
<li>WbGrepData did not work if tables were listed explicitely using the -tables parameter.</li>
<li>Auto completion was not working properly with Postgres and tables that were stored in the public schema.</li>
<li>"WbMode confirm" was not working if the profile was set to read only.</li>
<li>The BLOB dialog could not be opened from within a result set if the connection profile was set to read only.</li>
<li>Formatting UPDATEs with Sub-Select was not working properly</li>
<li>WbCopy now removes any trailing semicolon from the SQL query when using query based copying.</li>
</ul>
