      <description>        <![CDATA[<p>Changes from build 106 to build 106.2</p><p>Enhancements</p><ul>
<li>SQL Workbench/J now requires Java 6.</li>
<li>In the macro editor auto completion is now enabled (if the main window is connected)</li>
<li>workbench.settings will now only retain those properties that differ from the built-in defaults. This makes rolling out changes to the defaults easier. Any property that has been customized will remain in workbench.settings (but will not benefit from bugfixes made to the default properties)</li>
<li>Result tabs, can now be re-orderd using drag and drop.</li>
<li>The column definition of tables in the DbExplorer can now be edited and the approriate ALTER statement can be generated for the changes. Primary keys can be dropped and created from within the column definition.</li>
<li>Tables (and other objects if the database supports this) can now be renamed from within the table list of the DbExplorer. The comment for a table can also be changed. To apply the changes a new menu option in the context menu is available to generate and run the necessary ALTER statements.</li>
<li>The editor and resultset tabs can now have their own close button. (Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; General)</li>
<li>For SQL Server 2005 and above, synonyms are now retrieved in the DbExplorer.</li>
</ul><p>Bug Fixes</p><ul>
<li>The "Show Single Record Dialog" menu item in the table's popup menu was not always enabled.</li>
<li>When copying a macro, the keyboard shortcut was copied as well.</li>
<li>When cancelling the prompt to define an update table for a multi-table SELECT statement, an error was displayed.</li>
<li>WbGrepData did not work if tables were listed explicitely using the -tables parameter.</li>
<li>Auto completion was not working properly with Postgres and tables that were stored in the public schema.</li>
<li>"WbMode confirm" was not working if the profile was set to read only.</li>
<li>The BLOB dialog could not be opened from within a result set if the connection profile was set to read only.</li>
<li>Formatting UPDATEs with Sub-Select was not working properly</li>
<li>WbCopy now removes any trailing semicolon from the SQL query when using query based copying.</li>

      <title>New stable build (105) released</title>
      <description>        <![CDATA[<p>Changes from build 104 to build 105</p><p>Enhancements</p><ul>
<li>Added support for H2 domains and constants</li>
<li>For Postgres, if a SEQUENCE is tied to a column, this is now shown in the sequence's source and a comment is added for non serial columns in the table's source.</li>
<li>Postgres RULEs are now displayed in the DbExplorer</li>
<li>A new command WbMode is available which can change the "read only" and "confirm updates" setting for the current connection without modifying the underlying connection profile.</li>
<li>Values for non-Standard datatypes can now be edited in the result set provided the DBMS supports some kind of function of cast to convert a string literal to that datatype. Default casts for the following PostgreSQL datatypes have been added: inet, cidr, macaddr</li>
<li>A new help menu is available to display the online manual for the current DBMS. Default configurations (URLs) for PostgreSQL, Oracle, H2, HSQLDB, MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server have been added.</li>
<li>A new command WbGrepSource is available to search the source code of all database objects for specific values (patterns). A GUI for this is also available at "Tools -&gt; Search in object source".</li>
<li>The table search panel can now search with more sophisticated conditions. This is done by searching in the application rather than using a LIKE condition in a SELECT query. Both search types are available in the "Search Table Data" tab of the DbExplorer. The functionality of the client side search is now also available through the new Workbench command WbGrepData</li>
<li>Added support for SQL Server TYPEs in DbExplorer</li>
<li>The default label used for new tabs can now be configured using the property workbench.gui.tabs.defaultlabel in workbench.settings.</li>
<li>Added support for Postgres DOMAINs and ENUMs in DbExplorer</li>
<li>The text and background color for the editor, the message area and the data tables can now be configured</li>
<li>A new menu item to close all result tabs at once is available.</li>
<li>In the table definition display (columns) in the DbExplorer, a new popup menu item is available to create a default INSERT or SELECT statement for the selected columns.</li>
<li>A new parameter for WbExport is available: -sourceTablePrefix that defines a common prefix for all tables defined through -sourceTable. The prefix will be appended to all table names without any changes.</li>
<li>A new option to display information about database objects is available through "SQL -&gt; Object Info". If text is selected in the editor, this action will try to find a DB object with the name that is indicated by the selected text. It will look for tables, views, synonyms, sequences, procedures/functions and triggers. If something is found the definition (e.g. the list of columns) is displayed as a result set in the current SQL tab (the result will be appended). For objects with only a SQL source (e.g. a procedure) the source will be written into the messages tab.</li>
<li>When specifying date/time format string (e.g. when importing a file or in the options dialog), the input is now validated and an error message is shown.</li>
<li>The SQL Macros can now be displayed in a floating window. Double clicking a macro will run the macro in the currently selected SQL tab.</li>
<li>The generation of the source SQL for a table can now be configured in order to use the functions the DBMS supports (e.g. SHOW CREATE TABLE for MySQL), so that incompatibilities of the DBMS with the ANSI SQL standard can be worked around. A detailed description is in the manual in the section "Customize table source retrieval" of the chapter "Properties in the .settings file"</li>
<li>When using WbExport to generate HTML two new parameters can be used to specify HTML code that is added before and after the actual export data (-preDataHtml, -postDataHtml)</li>
</ul><p>Bug Fixes</p><ul>
<li>Exporting a table's data from within the table list in the DbExplorer was no longer working.</li>
<li>The default fetch size of a connection profile could not be reset (empty).</li>
<li>Fixed the autocompletion if a table was specified using schema.something.</li>
<li>Shortcut keys which involved the Enter could not be defined.</li>
<li>The Save As dialog to save result data now only checks for the update table and primary keys if needed.</li>
<li>Using PostgreSQL's DELETE ... RETURNING did not work.</li>
<li>Formatting a statment that used "AS ofx" for a column alias, would treat AS OF as a keyword and the formatted created a wrong syntax (AS OF x)</li>
<li>Dropping a function from within the DbExplorer generated the wrong SQL for Postgres</li>
<li>DESCRIBE is no longer handled by SQL Workbench/J when connected to a MySQL database.</li>
<li>When using WbImport with -header=false but no column definitions, the import would fail if the table had more columns than the import file. The additional columns of the table are now ignored as in previous versions.</li>
<li>"Create index" from within the table definition display in the DbExplorer was no longer working.</li>
<li>The "Object Info" feature did not work on Postgres if the selected object was a view.</li>
<li>In Oracle running a SELECT using a table name that was also used as a global symbol, the generated statements for changes in the result set referenced the schema PUBLIC instead of the current schema.</li>
<li>When re-ordering the columns using drag-and-drop and then displaying the single-record dialog, the content of the columns was mixed up.</li>
<li>When re-ordering the columns using drag-and-drop, the order was reset when changing data in the result.</li>
<li>The alternate delimiter was not always processed correctly.</li>
<li>When using the DataPumper to import text files and an invalid date format was specified, no table columns could be selected.</li>
<li>The -schemas parameter for WbReport was ignored.</li>
<li>When loading a new file into the editor while an error selection was present, the selection was still shown after the new file was loaded.</li>
<li>When prompting vor variables, entering an empty value would remove the variable from the internal variables pool. It is now stored with an empty string as its value.</li>
<li>(Un)Comment selection did not work if the cursor was in the very first column and no lines where selected.</li>
<li>For WbCopy -createTarget was not working if the source was a query.</li>
</ul>

      <title>New stable build (104) released</title>
      <description>        <![CDATA[<p>Changes from build 103 to build 104</p><p>Enhancements</p><ul>

<li>It is now possible to cycle through the tabs using Ctrl-Tab and Ctrl-Shift-Tab</li>
<li>The keyboard shortcuts for editor movements can now be configured. The defaults have been adjusted to comply with the Apple guidelines on Mac OS</li>
<li>The generating SQL query of a result tab can now be displayed by double-clicking on the tab or through the context menu of the result tab.</li>
<li>WbCopy (and the DataPumper) now optionally ignores any error that occurs when dropping the target table. For that, a new parameter is available -ignoreDropError which defaults to false</li>
<li>When using XSLT to transform output of e.g. WbReport or WbSchemaDiff, the name of the stylesheet can now be specified without a pathname if located in the xslt subdirectory or the config directory.</li>
<li>When assigning a keyboard shortcut to a macro, the shortcut's character would be inserted into the editor when the macro was executed.</li>
<li>CHECK constraints are now reported individually in the output of WbReport and WbSchemaDiff. WbSchemaDiff has a new parameter to match check constraints by name or by expression only.</li>
<li>A result name (defined using @wbresult) is now used as the header when printing the result.</li>
<li>The editor can now be configured to either uses spaces or real tab characters (as before)</li>
<li>The editor can now be scrolled without moving the caret by using Ctrl-Down and Ctrl-Up</li>
<li>Autocompletion is now supported for the SQL statement EXEC and will show a list of stored procedures. WbCall and CALL are also recognized.</li>
<li>When showing the sequence definition for an Oracle sequence the column LAST_NUMBER is now also displayed in the DbExplorer</li>
<li>When defining a new filter for a result set, the currently selected column is now pre-selected in the dropdown if no filter is defined.</li>
<li>When using WbCopy's -createTarget=true, data type mappings can now be specified in workbench.settings that enhance or overwrite the data type mapping returned by the driver. Details can be found in the manual.</li>
<li>Manually changed column order in the table data of the DbExplorer can now be saved. Either manually through the popup menu of the table header, or automatically through an option for the DbExplorer.</li>
<li>When defining the jar library for a Look &amp; Feel, the application now scans the libraries for the approriate classes</li>
<li>Removed the limitations that DbExplorer panels must be the last tabs and cannot be the only tab.</li>
<li>A new option is available to customize how external files that are loaded in an editor tab are remembered in the workspace.</li>
<li>A single record dialog is now available to edit data in a result set (Data -&gt; Single record dialog)</li>
<li>A new option to control the use of uppercase keywords for the SQL formatter is available (Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; SQL Formatter)</li>
</ul><p>Bug Fixes</p><ul>
