  <h1>A DBMS independent SQL Tool.</h1>
  It can be used as a GUI SQL editor, a commandline SQL interface or in batch mode.<br/>
  <br/>
  The functionality offered by e.g. {@link workbench.sql.wbcommands.WbImport} or {@link workbench.sql.wbcommands.WbExport}
  can be used through their respective backend classes e.g. {@link workbench.db.importer.DataImporter}.<br/>
  <br/>
  To use any of the Workbench classes inside another program, you have to call {@link workbench.WbManager#prepareForEmbedded()}. If you want
  to use Log4J as the logging sub-system from your program, you have to set the systeem property <tt>workbench.log.log4j</tt> to true.
