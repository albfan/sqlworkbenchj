Implementation of Workbench specific SQL commands.
<br/>
A new internal command needs to be registered in two places:
<ul>
	<li>{@link workbench.sql.CommandMapper}</li>
	<li>{@link workbench.sql.wbcommands.CommandTester}</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The <tt>CommandMapper</tt> class is used to find the implementation
  of a SQL command during execution of SQL script.
</p>
<p>
	The <tt>CommandTester</tt> is used to identifiy Workbench internal commands
	e.g. during formatting or for syntax highlighting in the editor. It also drives
	the list of commands that are listed when running <tt>WbHelp</tt> in the console.
