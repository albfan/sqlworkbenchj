		<para>You can load and save the editor's content into external files (e.g. for re-using)
			them in other SQL tools.
		</para>
		<para>
			To load a file use <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Open...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
			or right click on the tab's label and choose <guimenuitem>Open...</guimenuitem> from the popup
			menu.

		<para>
			The association between an editor tab and the external file will be saved
			in the workspace that is used for the current connection. When opening the
			workspace (e.g. by connecting using a profile that is linked to that workspace) the
			external file will be loaded as well.
		</para>
		<note><para>
			If you want to run very large SQL scripts (e.g. over 15MB) it is recommended
			to execute them using <link linkend="command-wbinclude">WbInclude</link> rather
			than loading them completely into the editor. <literal>WbInclude</literal>
			will not load the script into memory, thus you can even run scripts that would not fit into memory.

	<section id="command-completion">
		<title>Code completion</title>
		<para>
			The editor can show a popup window with a list of available tables (and views) or
			a list of available columns for a table. Which list is displayed depends on the position
			of the cursor inside the statement.
		</para>
		<para>
			If the cursor is located in the column list of a <literal>SELECT</literal> statement
			and the <literal>FROM</literal> part already contains the necessary tables, the window
			will show the columns available in the table. Assuming you are editing the following
			statement ( the <literal>|</literal> indicating the position of the caret):
		</para>
		<programlisting>SELECT p.|, p.firstname, a.zip, a.city
FROM person p
  JOIN address a ON p.id = a.person_id;</programlisting>
		<para>
			then pressing the <keycap>Ctrl-Space</keycap> key will show a list of columns available
			in the <literal>PERSON</literal> table (because the cursor is located after the <literal>p.</literal>
			alias). If you put the cursor after the <literal>a.city</literal> column and press the
			<keycap>Ctrl-Space</keycap> the popup window will list the two tables that are referenced
			in the <literal>FROM</literal> part of the statement. The behavior when editing the
			<literal>WHERE</literal> part of an statement is similar.
		</para>

		<para>
			When editing the list of tables in the <literal>FROM</literal> part of the statement,
			pressing the <keycap>Ctrl-Space</keycap> will pop up a list of available tables.
		</para>

    <para>
      If the cursor is located inside the assignment of an <literal>UPDATE</literal> statement (<literal>set foo = |, </literal>)
      or in the <literal>VALUES</literal> part of an <literal>INSERT</literal> statement, the popup will contain
      an item <literal>(Select FK value)</literal>. When selecting this item <link linkend="edit-fk-lookup">the dialog</link>
      to select a value from a referenced table will be displayed if the current column is referencing another
      table. For performance reasons the check if the current column is referencing another table is only
      done <emphasis>after</emphasis> the item has been selected. If no foreign key could be found, a message
      is displayed in the status bar.
    </para>

		<para>
			The editor assumes that the standard semicolon is used to separate statements when doing auto-completion
      or using the "Execute current" function. This can be changed to a non-standard behaviour through
      the <link linkend="options-empty-line-delimiter">options dialog </link> so that the editor also recognizes empty
      lines as a statement delimiter.
		</para>

		<para>
			Parameters for &wb-productname; specific commands are also supported by the command completion.
			The parameters will only be shown, if you have already typed the leading dash, e.g.
			<literal>WbImport -</literal>. If you press the shortcut for the command completion while
			the cursor is located after the dash, a list of available options for the current comand is
			shown. Once the parameter has been added, you can display a list of possible values
			for the parameter if the cursor is located after the equals sign.
			for <literal>WbImport -mode=</literal> will display a list of allowed values for the
			<literal>-mode</literal> parameter. For parameters where table names can be supplied
			the usual table list will be shown.

	<section id="insert-value-hinting">
		<title>Show hints for INSERT statements</title>
    <para>
      When writing (long) <literal>INSERT</literal> statements it is often helpful to check if a specific value
      is actually written into the intended column. To check the column a value corresponds to (or the vice versa),
      press <keycap>Ctrl-#</keycap> while in the column or values list. A tool tip will appear to show the corresponding
      element from the "other" part of the statement. Consider the following statement:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
INSERT INTO some_table (column1, column2, column3)
VALUES
('hello', 'world', 42, 'foobar');
</programlisting>
    <para>
      When the cursor is located at <literal>column1</literal>, pressing <keycap>Ctrl-#</keycap> will show a tool tip containing the text
      <literal>'hello'</literal> as that is the value that corresponds to column1. When the cursor is located at the number <literal>42</literal>
      pressing <keycap>Ctrl-#</keycap> will show the text <literal>column3</literal> in the tool tip.
    </para>
    <para>
      When no matching column or value can be found, the tool tip will contain a hint that the "other" element is missing.
    </para>
    <para>
      If the values inserted are the result of a <literal>SELECT</literal> statement, the tool tip in the
      insert column list will show the corresponding column name from the SELECT statement.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section id="editor-custom-keywords">
		<title>Customizing keyword highlighting</title>
		<para>
			The keywords that the editor can highlight are based on an internal list of keywords
			and information obtained from the JDBC driver. You can extend the list of known keywords
			using text files located in the <link linkend="config-dir">config directory</link>.
		</para>
		<para>
			&wb-productname; reads four different types of keywords: regular keywords (e.g. SELECT),
			data types (e.g. VARCHAR), functions (e.g. upper()) and operators (e.g. JOIN). Each keyword type
			is read from a separate file: <literal>keywords.wb</literal>, <literal>datatypes.wb</literal>,
			<literal>functions.wb</literal> and <literal>operators.wb</literal>.
		</para>
		<para>
			The files contain one keyword per line. Case does not matter (<literal>SELECT</literal>
			and <literal>select</literal> are treated identically).
			If you want to add a specific word to the list of global keywords, simply create a plain
			text file <literal>keywords.wb</literal> in the <link linkend="config-dir">config directory</link>
			and put one keyword per line into the file, e.g:
		</para>
		<programlisting>ALIAS
ADD
ALTER</programlisting>
		<para>
			If you want to define keywords specific for a DBMS, you need to add the <link linkend="dbid">DBID</link>
			as a prefix to the filename, e.g. <literal>oracle.datatypes.wb</literal>.
		</para>
		<para>
			To add the word <literal>geometry</literal> as a datatype for the editor when connected to a PostgreSQL
			database, create the file <literal>postgresql.datatypes.wb</literal> in the config directory with the
			following contents:<programlisting>geometry</programlisting>
			The words defined for a specific database are added to the globally recognized keywords, so you
			don't need to repeat all existing words in the file.
		</para>
		<para>
			The color for each type of keyword can be changed in the options dialog.

	<section id="editor-reformat-sql" xreflabel="SQL Formatter">
		<title>Reformat SQL</title>
		<para>When you analyze statements from e.g. a log file, they are not necessarily formatted in a way that
			can be easily read, let alone understood. The editor of the &wb-productname; can reformat SQL statements
			into a format that's easier to read and understand for a human being. This feature is often called pretty-printing.
			Suppose you have the following statement (pasted from a log file)
		</para>

		<programlisting>select user.* from user, user_profile, user_data
where user.user_id = user_profile.user_id and
user_profile.user_id = uprof.user_id and user_data.user_role = 1
and user_data.delete_flag = 'F' and not exists
(select 1 from data_detail where data_detail.id = user_data.id and
data_detail.flag = 'X' and data_detail.value > 42)</programlisting>
		<para>this will be reformatted to look like this:</para>
		<programlisting>SELECT user.*
FROM user,
     user_profile,
     user_data
WHERE user.user_id = user_profile.user_id
AND   user_profile.user_id = uprof.user_id
AND   user_data.user_role = 1
AND   user_data.delete_flag = 'F'
AND   NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1
                  FROM data_detail
                  WHERE data_detail.id = user_data.id
                  AND   data_detail.flag = 'x'
                  AND   data_detail.value &gt; 42)</programlisting>

		<para>You can configure a threshold up to which sub-<literal>SELECT</literal>s will not be reformatted but
			put into one single line. The default for this threshold is 80 characters. Meaning that any
			subselect that is shorter than 80 characters will not be reformatted as the sub-<literal>SELECT</literal>
			in the above example. Please refer to <link linkend="options-sql-formatting">Formatting options</link> for details.

			Sometimes when you Copy &amp; Paste lines of text from e.g. a spreadsheet, you might want to use those values
			as a condition for a SQL <literal>IN</literal> expression. Suppose you a have a list of ID's in your
			spreadsheet each in one row of the same column. If you copy and paste this into the editor, each ID

			<title>Clean Java code</title>
			<para>
				When using the <xref linkend="editor-copy-java-code-snippet"/> feature during

			<para>
				For better performance Java applications usually make use of

				The SQL for a prepared statement does not contain the actual values that should be used e.g.
				in the WHERE clause, but uses quotation marks instead. Let's assume the above example should be
				enhanced to retrieve the person information for a specific ID. The code could look like

			</para>

			<para>
				You can copy and <link linkend="editor-clean-java-code">clean</link> the SQL statement
				but you will not be able to execute it, because there is no value available for the parameter

				Once the prepared statement detection is enabled, &wb-productname; will examine

				is delegated to the JDBC driver and does cause some overhead when running the statement.
				For performance reasons you should disable the detection, if you are not using
				prepared statements in the editor (especially when running large scripts).
			</para>
			<para>If a prepared statement is detected, you will be prompted to enter a value for each defined
				parameter. The dialog will list all parameters of the statement together with their type as returned
				by the JDBC driver. Once you have entered a value for each parameter, clicking OK
				will execute the statement using those values. When you execute the SQL statement
				the next time, the old values will be preserved, and you can either use them again
				or modify them before running the statement.
