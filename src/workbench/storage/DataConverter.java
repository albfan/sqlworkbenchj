/**
 *
 * An interface for the RowData class to "convert" data that is read from the database
 * on the fly.
 * <br/>
 * Any new implementation should be created through {@link RowDataReader#getConverterInstance(workbench.db.WbConnection)   }
 * to ensure that the RowData class actually uses the converter.
 * <br/><br/>
 * An implementation of this interface should be done as a singleton, because a reference to the
 * converter is passed to every RowData instance that is created in the factory. Therefor a Singleton is
 * is recommended to avoid too many instances of the implementing class.
