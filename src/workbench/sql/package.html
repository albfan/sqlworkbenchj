Classes to handle SQL scripts and statements.

A {@link workbench.sql.StatementRunner} is used to execute a single SQL Statement. <br/>
A {@link workbench.sql.BatchRunner} is used to run a sequence of SQL statements that are
delimited with a defined delimiter (semicolon beeing the default).

The BatchRunner uses the {@link workbench.sql.ScriptParser} to split the sequence of 
SQL Statements into individual statements.
