/**
 * A focus manager which can grab focus traversal keys before they
 * are processed by the actual compontents. This is necessary to
 * allow Ctrl-Tab to switch tabs in the MainWindow. If no FocusManager
 * is installed, Ctrl-Tab will jump inside the current tabt to the next
 * focusable component, even if an action is registered with the Ctrl-Tab
 * keystroke.
 * <br>
 * WbFocusManager can grab two actions (see grabActions()). If the shortcuts
 * for those actions are pressed, the action is called directly, otherwise the
 * event is handed to the DefaultFocusManager.
 * <br>
 * Currently only two (named) actions are supported, but this can easily
 * be changed to support a variable number of actions by storing them
 * in a Map.
